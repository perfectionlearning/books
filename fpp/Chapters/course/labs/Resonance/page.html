<div class="pLabPageIntro">
	Plucking the string of a musical instrument sends disturbances racing along the string at speeds that can exceed 220 m/s (about 500 mph). These traveling disturbances − or waves − rush to each end of the string and reflect back. The reflected waves interfere with the waves that caused them. 
	</br></br>
	The results of wave interference in a string explain the musical notes you hear when a guitar, harp or other stringed instrument is played. A similar form of wave interference causes the musical notes you hear in wind instruments, such as a clarinet. 
	</br></br>
	This lab explores the patterns caused by wave interference in a plucked string. You will see how the properties of the string combined with the variables that describe the wave in the string dictate the sound frequency, or the pitch that you recognize as a note in a musical scale. 
	</br></br>
	By the end, you can use your knowledge of wave mechanics in a string to play the opening bars of a Beethoven symphony, or to team with your classmates to play a three-part blues.

	</br>
	Plucking a string causes it to vibrate. These vibrations, which vibrate the air at the same frequency, are the source of musical notes.
	</br></br>
	You can start this exploration of the role of waves in music by playing a very simple stringed instrument in the first simulation.
	</br></br>
	Here, a string is stretched taut between two struts, like a string on a guitar, as shown in the picture below.

		<figcaption style="font-family: AvenirNextLTPro-Demi;">Exercise 1. Hear the relationship between string length and musical notes.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	</br>
	You can pluck the string and then listen to the sound created by the vibrating string. You can also observe the motion of the string, as we have slowed its motion by 100 times so you can see it. 
	</br></br>
	The rightmost support (strut) holding the string is movable. You can slide it to the left, shortening the effective length of the string (as you do so, the tension of the string remains constant.) A gauge in the display will tell you what fraction the effective length is of the original length. You can create string lengths ranging from 1/4 to 15/16 of the initial length. 
	</br></br>
	Try some different string lengths and listen to the musical notes created when you pluck the string. Are they different? How so? Also observe the string. Does a particle in the shorter string move up and down more times per second than one in a longer string? Is there a relationship between string length and frequency? Try alternating between the extremes in length to make this relationship most notable. 
	</br></br>
	See if you can hear a relationship between frequency and the pitch of the sound created by the plucked string.

		In the simulation, pressing PLAY causes a finger to pluck the string. Using headphones or your computer’s speakers, listen to the sound created by the plucked string.

		Experiment by varying the length of the string. Click on the rightmost strut and slide it to the left. This shortens the length of the string.

	</br>
	Some basic concepts describe the waves that are moving in the plucked string.
	</br></br>
	The <b>amplitude, A</b>, of a wave is the maximum displacement of the string above or below its undisturbed position. The height of a peak is the amplitude of a wave. It is stated in meters. 
	</br></br>
	The <b>frequency, f</b>, of a wave is the number of complete, up and down cycles per second of a particle in the string. It is stated in hertz (Hz). 
	</br></br>
	The <b>wavelength, λ</b>, is the distance between two adjacent identical points in a wave. It is measured in meters. You can measure it as the horizontal distance between two adjacent peaks or two adjacent troughs. 
	</br></br>
	The <b>wave speed, v</b>, is the speed at which the wave travels along the string. (You were not able to see the waves traveling to and fro in the first exercise, for reasons that will be explained later.) Wave speed is related to the wave frequency and wavelength by the following equation: 
	</br></br>
	<img src= "course/labs/Resonance/assets/image30.gif">
	</br></br>
	Wave speed is given in meters per second.
	</br></br>
	Review these properties of a wave in the following simulation. It shows a conceptual view of a wave. The wave originates at the left edge of the screen, and moves to the right. There are no boundaries (no places where the string is tied down or attached to struts), so the wave is free to move from left to right without reflecting back. 
	</br></br>
	<div class="pLabQASection">
		In the simulation, press GO to start the wave moving. Using the grid on the screen, measure and report the wave’s amplitude. Also measure and report the wavelength. (Pressing PAUSE to freeze the wave will assist you in making these measurements. You can press PAUSE again to resume the simulation as well.)
		</br></br>
		Using the timer in the control panel, determine the frequency and the speed of the wave. You can measure its speed by noting the change in position of a peak over time. Note that the time is displayed in milliseconds, though we report speed in the usual m/s. 
		</br></br>
		Using the “Time step” buttons may help you make these measurements. The time step buttons allow you to advance or rewind the wave in small increments of time.

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Exercise 3: Superposition </div>
	</br>
	When a string is plucked, multiple wave pulses are created that travel along the string, reflecting off the two ends where the string is attached to the struts. The beginning simulation did not show this level of detail.
	</br></br>
	You now explore what happens when two waves meet at the same place on a plucked string. The waves interfere with one another, and the result of their interference can take several forms. 
	</br></br>
	To determine what occurs when two waves or wave pulses meet, you apply the principle of superposition. At every point, the displacement of the combined wave can be determined by adding the displacements of the two source waves. 
	</br></br>
	Observe superposition in the following simulation. Here, we show a conceptual view of two waves in a string. These are single wave pulses, one of which originates at the left edge of the screen, and the other at the right edge. The wave pulses travel in opposite directions at the same speed and will meet in the middle. 
	</br></br>
	What will be the result if two positive wave pulses (i.e., two peaks) of the same height combine? What if one of the pulses is inverted into a trough (with negative displacement)? What if the two pulse amplitudes differ? 
	</br></br>
	<div class="pLabQASection">
		Use the simulation to answer the questions stated above. Use the amplitude controls in the control panel to set the maximum displacement of each wave pulse, then press GO to watch the wave pulses move across the screen and combine in the middle. 
		</br></br>
		Try combining two positive pulses of equal amplitude, say, 1.5 m. What is the result when the wave pulses combine?
		</br></br>
		In order to see the result − and measure it with the background graph − it is helpful to slow the simulation speed as the wave pulses meet. Use the time step function to advance or rewind the experiment, one frame at a time.
		</br></br>
		Next, try combining a peak with an equal amplitude trough. What is the result? (We use a negative sign with the amplitude of a trough to indicate the wave displacement is below the equilibrium position. This is necessary for the simulation, but by convention, amplitude is stated as a positive value.) What happens when wave pulses of amplitude 1.5 m and −1.5 m meet? 
		</br></br>
		Try different displacements, such as 2.0 m for one and 1.0 m for the other. What do you expect to see when they combine?

	</br>
	When the string of a musical instrument is plucked, a wave travels down the string until it reaches the end, where the string is tied to a post or strut. Then the wave reflects off the strut and begins traveling back in the other direction. 
	</br></br>
	In this simulation and the one following, we will examine in some detail what happens when a wave reflects back on itself, using a single wave pulse as the basis of our analysis. 
	</br></br>
	In this simulation, a single wave pulse starts at the left edge of the screen and travels down the string to the right. On the right the string is connected to a hook attached firmly to a wall. This is a fixed point. The end of the string cannot move up or down.

	You have seen how waves combine when they meet and how a single wave pulse reflects off of a fixed point.
	</br></br>
	Both of these things occur when a string is plucked in a musical instrument. Waves are sent in both directions along the string, reflect off the end struts and interfere with one another after reflecting. The reflected waves then travel toward the other end, reflect again, and so on. 
	</br></br>
	What is the result when these two effects are combined?

<div class="pExerciseContainer">
	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Exercise 6: Standing waves and frequency</div>
	</br>
	What you observed in the prior simulation is called a standing wave, a wave that does not travel along the string. If the wave machine works in synchronization with the reflected waves to create a standing wave, we say that it is working in resonance. Its motion reinforces the waves, and the amplitude of the resulting standing wave will be greater than the amplitude of the vibrations of the wave machine. This is akin to you pushing a friend on a swing. If you time the frequency of your “pushes” correctly, you will send your friend higher. 
	</br></br>
	The peaks and troughs of a standing wave stay at fixed positions on the horizontal axis. When you pluck a string, multiple waves travel up and down the string, and multiple standing waves are established in the string. 
	</br></br>
	Now let’s see how this relates to the musical notes you hear when you pluck a string.
	</br></br>
	You have seen that the higher the frequency of a wave in a particular plucked string, the higher the pitch of the sound produced by the vibrating string. 
	</br></br>
	And you also have seen that the speed of a traveling wave in a string is related to its wavelength and frequency by the following equation: 
	</br></br>
	<img src= "course/labs/Resonance/assets/image30.gif">
	</br></br>
	The speed of a wave is constant in a given string with a fixed tension. Based on the equation above, if v is constant, how could you change the frequency of the wave in our plucked string in order to change the pitch of the sound you hear? 
	</br></br>
	The answer is: Change the wavelength of the wave.
	</br></br>
	In the simplest configuration − a string fixed at two ends − one standing wave dominates the rest. It occurs at the fundamental frequency of the string. (We will explore the other standing waves later.) 
	</br></br>
	The wavelength of this dominant standing wave is determined by the length of the string. The string is fixed at two ends. When you pluck a string, one-half of a wave appears over the entire length, L, of the string. You see this half wavelength in the diagram below. 
	</br></br>
	<img src= "course/labs/Resonance/assets/image31.gif">
	</br></br>
	<figure style="padding-top:20px;padding-bottom:10px;">
		<img class="pExcersiseThumb" src="course/labs/Resonance/assets/image012.gif" style="width:70%;"/>
		</br></br>
		<figcaption style="font-family: AvenirNextLTPro-Demi;">Two nodes make for half a wavelength.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	</br>
	If you decrease the length of the string, you also decrease the wavelength.
	</br></br>
	Remembering that
	, we can solve this equation for λ and substitute it into the wavelength equation above to derive an equation relating frequency to the wave speed v and length L: 
	</br></br>
	<img src= "course/labs/Resonance/assets/image32.gif">
	</br></br>
	This is the principle at work when you move the wooden end strut of our stringed instrument to change the length of the string. Any change in the length of the string forces a change in the wavelength of the fundamental standing wave on the string. The shorter the string, the shorter the wavelength. The shorter the wavelength, the higher the frequency and the higher the pitch.
	</br></br>
	The wave speed v is constant in a particular string at a set tension. This means that the length of the string and the frequency of the dominant standing wave in the string are inversely proportional. 
	</br></br>
	Experiment with standing waves and frequency in this simulation.
	</br></br>
	<div class="pLabQASection">
		This simulation consists of a string stretched between two struts, similar to a guitar string. The wave speed is 200 m/s in this string. You can pluck the string and then listen to the sound created by the vibrating string. You can also observe the vibration of the fundamental standing wave in the string, as we have slowed the motion of the string by 100 times so you can see it. 
		</br></br>
		Without changing the string length, press PLAY to pluck the string. A standing wave is established in the string. What is its frequency? Its wavelength? Use the simulation to answer these questions, and record your answers in the spaces provided below. 
		</br></br>
		The rightmost strut holding the string is movable. You can slide it to the left, shortening the effective length of the string (as you do so, the tension of the string remains constant. If the tension were to change, so would the wave speed.) 
		</br></br>
		Move the strut until the length of the string is 1/2 the original length. Remember, this cuts the wavelength of the wave on the string in half as well. Before you try this, predict the frequency. Pluck the string. Is the frequency what you expected? Try some other length ratios, such as 1/3, 1/4 and so on. 
		</br></br>
		Finally, if you want to create a sound of frequency 165 Hz, what would you make the length of the string? Calculate an answer and then try it in the simulation.

	As you saw in Exercise 6, when you pluck a string it vibrates primarily at the fundamental frequency.
	</br></br>
	Imagine fixing your gaze at a single particle in the string and following it. The point you pick oscillates up and down, completing a certain number of cycles per second. If you were to pick another particle in the string, it would also oscillate up at down, at the same frequency, but likely with a different amplitude. However, there are special points along the string that bear special attention.

	Nodes are points of zero displacement, places on a standing wave where the particles in the medium do not oscillate at all. The fixed endpoints of the string are examples of nodes. That is a trivial example, but we will shortly explain how other nodes can arise between the fixed endpoints. (Perhaps you remember the observations you made in Exercise 5?) 
	</br></br>
	An antinode is a point of maximum displacement, where the standing wave reaches the greatest amplitude. The point at the middle of the string in the exercise above was an antinode. This is where you see the peaks and troughs. 
	</br></br>
	One of the intriguing aspects of a stringed instrument is that there are other standing waves on the string at frequencies other than the fundamental one. These other standing waves also have nodes at the fixed ends of the string. In addition, they have one or more nodes positioned at regular intervals along the string. 
	</br></br>
	These other standing waves, oscillating at different frequencies than the fundamental, create musical notes of a different pitch from the fundamental. This is the reason the sound created when you pluck a single guitar string is so rich. You are hearing multiple notes, as these waves are superposed on top of each other, though the sound is dominated by the fundamental frequency. A harmonic is sometimes called a resonance frequency or a natural frequency. 
	</br></br>
	Given a plucked, vibrating string, you can create other standing waves by forcing a node at various positions along the string. If you touch the vibrating string gently in the middle and keep your finger there, you force a change in the shape of the string and create a node at that point, which changes the wavelength of the standing wave. The newly created standing wave has three nodes instead of two. The wavelength is now equal to the length of the string. That is, the wavelength has been cut in half by your action. Since you reduced the wavelength in half, the frequency doubles, and the new pitch is higher. 
	</br></br>
	You can go further with this by placing your finger 1/3 of the way along the vibrating string, forcing a node at that position instead. This results in a standing wave with four nodes (one at each end, one that is 1/3 of the way along the string, and a matching one that is 2/3 of the way along the string), and a wavelength only one-third as long as that of the fundamental wave. The frequency of this wave is three times higher than the fundamental frequency. 
	</br></br>
	These different possible standing waves on a plucked string are called <b>harmonics</b>.
	</br></br>
	In general, a harmonic is a standing wave with a wavelength that obeys this equation:
	</br></br>
	<img src= "course/labs/Resonance/assets/image33.gif">
	</br></br>
				where n = 1, 2, 3…. 	
	</br></br>
	The frequency equation now becomes:
	</br></br>

	</br></br>
	<div class="pLabQASection">
		</br>
		Experiment with harmonics in the next simulation. It again features a string stretched between two struts, similar to a guitar string. As before, you can pluck the string and listen to the sound created by the vibrating string. You can also observe the vibration of the standing wave in the string, as we have slowed the motion of the string by 100 times so you can see it. 
		</br></br>
		First, press PLAY to pluck the string. A standing wave with a frequency of 66 Hz is established in the string.
		</br></br>
		Next to the string you will see a second hand, with the finger pointing down. You can drag this hand to place it between the left strut to the midpoint of the string. It gently touches the vibrating string to cause nodes, and standing waves of different wavelengths. The plucking hand will continue to pluck the string as before. 
		</br></br>
		Try placing the harmonic finger at the halfway point, establishing a node there. What do you think will be the dominant frequency of the vibrating string? 
		</br></br>
		Try some other positions, such as 1/3 of the way from the end, 1/4, etc. Observe the relationship between the point at which the finger is placed, the new wavelength established and the new frequency.

	</br>
	Now you have learned two different methods of playing a variety of musical notes on a single string. Both involve changing the wavelength (and thus the frequency) of standing waves vibrating on the plucked string: 
	</br></br>
			<ul style='list-style-type:disc;padding-left: 18px;'>
				<li>You can change the length of the string. Shortening a string shortens the wavelength of the fundamental standing wave on the string, which increases its frequency. </li>
				<li>You can force nodes at various points along the vibrating string by placing a finger there, creating a node at that point. This creates a standing wave with a different wavelength and frequency than the fundamental wave.</li>
			</ul>
	</br></br>
	Now you use this knowledge to play one of the most famous openings in music: the first four bars of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony.
	</br></br>
	In the simulation, you will see four strings, each of which must be tuned by you to play a different note:
	</br>

	</br>
	You can tune the strings numbered 2 and 3 by changing each length. You can tune the strings numbered 1 and 4 by gently touching the string at the appropriate place to create a harmonic. The following table states the fundamental frequencies for these strings, and the target frequency for the notes you want to play. It also reminds you how to tune it: either by changing its length, or by placing a finger on the string to alter its frequency.

		Bring yourself another step closer to Carnegie Hall by mastering the simulation. You will see four strings. You want the string number 1, which has a fundamental frequency of 49.5 Hz, to play a G in the 3<sup>rd</sup> octave (G<sub>3</sub>), which has a frequency of 198 Hz. Determine where to place the finger on this string once it is vibrating in order to create a standing wave of this frequency.
		</br></br>
		Then, program string number 2. It has a fundamental frequency of 132 Hz. You want to play an E<sup>b</sup> in the third octave, which has a frequency of 158.4 Hz. Determine where to move the right-hand strut to change the length of the string to create a wave of this frequency. 
		</br></br>
		Continue by programming string 3 by changing the length, and string 4 by establishing a harmonic.
		</br></br>
		When you are done, you can press PLAY and the computer will pluck your strings in the correct sequence and timing to play the first four bars of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony. You should be able to hear right away whether you tuned the strings correctly. (To hear what Beethoven’s Fifth sounds like, click below.)

		A gauge next to each string displays the frequency sounded by that string when it is plucked. If you hit any wrong notes, retune the appropriate strings until you play the song correctly. 
		</br></br>
		You can also release your inner conductor, and control the order and duration of the notes using your number keypad. Pressing the 1 key will play the number 1 string, the 2 key the number 2 string, and so on. To play Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony as originally written, play the notes in this order: 1 1 1 2 … 3 3 3 4 … (Play the 1 string three times in a row in rapid succession, followed by the 2 string once, held for a few beats. Then play the 3 string three times in rapid succession, followed by the 4 string once, held for a few beats.) Or play it as you think it should be played!

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Exercise 9 (optional): Playing the Physics Blues </div>
	</br>
	You can use what you know about waves in plucked strings to join with your classmates and play a three-part blues.
	</br></br>
	In this exercise there are three stringed instruments. The first is a guitar. It is similar to the instrument you have been playing thus far, but this one has eight strings. You can program it by changing string length or using harmonics. You can use the guitar to play the melody of a blues song we have written, or that of any song you like. 
	</br></br>
	The second instrument is a piano. It has nine strings. You program the notes here the same way as the guitar’s notes. Unlike the other instruments, the piano plays multiple strings at once to form chords to accompany the melody on the guitar. You will tune the strings of the piano, and the chords will be played automatically.
	</br></br>
	The third instrument is a bass, with 11 strings. Use it to play the bass line.
	</br></br>
	As you may suspect, this is a good activity for teams of students. Each group can choose an instrument and program the correct notes. When each team is done, the parts can be played simultaneously, either on one computer or on three separate computers, to form a three-part blues band. 
	</br></br>
	Start by setting the <b>bass</b> line. Here is the table of information for programming the bass:

		In this simulation, you will see tabs on the control panel marked “Bass,” “Guitar” and “Piano.” Each tab takes you to a simulation window in which you can program the notes for that instrument.

		When you are done programming an instrument, you can press PLAY to hear the instrument play its part in the physics blues. The computer plays the notes as you have programmed them, though it takes care of the tempo and type of note (eighth note, quarter note, etc.). 
		</br></br>
		If other teams have programmed instruments on their computers, press PLAY on all the computers simultaneously to hear what they sound like together. Alternatively, you can program all three instruments on one computer and then check the boxes labeled "Bass", "Guitar", and "Piano" to hear all three parts at once.

		A frequency gauge displays the frequency of the standing waves on the strings as they are played. You can play the notes individually using your number keypad. Pressing the 1 key will play the number 1 string, the 2 key the number 2 string, and so on. To play the piano chords, press C, F, or G. These keys will play the three chords used in the composition. (If you are a pianist or guitarist, you may recognize these chords as seventh chords, major triads with a flatted seventh note.) See if these values match the values for the target frequency in the table above. If any do not, retune those strings until you play the part correctly.
