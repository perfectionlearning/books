	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Exercise 1: Juggling one ball</div>
	Throwing a single ball into the air and catching it may not seem like juggling. But the simple catch and throw is the basis for all juggling. Jugglers must be able to throw a ball to a consistent height and judge precisely when and where it will land.
	</br></br>
	A common way to learn to juggle is to start with one ball, throwing it so that it stays in the air for a consistent amount of <b>time</b>.
	</br>

		<figcaption style="font-family: AvenirNextLTPro-Demi;">Exercise 1. Pick an initial vertical velocity to keep the ball in the air for 1.4 seconds.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	In the first exercise, your challenge is to determine the initial vertical velocity so that the ball’s time of flight, or hang time, is 1.4 seconds. This time is how long it takes the ball to rise to its peak and fall back to its initial height, where the juggler will catch it.
	</br></br>
	When a ball is thrown upward, the force of gravity causes it to accelerate at a constant rate, slowing the ball as it rises and then speeding it up as it falls. While the ball is in the air, its acceleration is −9.80 m/s<sup>2</sup>. The magnitude of this acceleration is represented by g; the sign is negative because the acceleration is downward.
	</br></br>
	A ball thrown upward has positive “y“, or vertical, velocity. The ball slows until its velocity is zero at the peak of its motion. After that, the ball continues to accelerate at −9.80 m/s<sup>2</sup>, which means it then has negative y velocity and is moving downward.

	The equations shown in the box above describe this linear freefall motion. Throughout the lab, you may make use of some or all of these motion equations.
	</br></br>
	Because in this lab you will use these equations to determine motion in the vertical direction, we specify the displacement as Δy.
	</br></br>
	The same equations also can be used to describe motion in the horizontal direction. In that case, Δx is substituted for Δy.
	</br></br>
	As stated, the variable a in this lab is the acceleration due to gravity, −9.80 m/s<sup>2</sup>. 
	</br></br>
	Later, we will introduce the horizontal velocity with which the juggler throws the ball from one hand to the other. For now, the juggler throws a single ball up and back down to the same hand.

		Test your answer in the juggling simulation.
		</br></br>
		When you open the simulation, you will see a control panel at the bottom. It contains one input gauge, marked "Initial y velocity.” This controls the vertical (y) component of the ball's velocity.
		</br></br>
		You should specify a value in the “Initial y velocity” gauge, in meters per second, m/s. (The ball’s x velocity is fixed at 0 m/s, although you will be able to adjust it later in this lab.) Again, your goal is to throw the ball straight up in the air so that its total time of flight − up and then down − is as close as possible to 1.4 seconds.
		</br></br>
		Once you have specified a value for the y velocity, press GO. Is the total flight time 1.4 seconds? The stop watch provided in the control panel runs automatically and will enable you to see if your initial velocity is correct.
		</br></br>
		Don’t worry if you do not get it right the first time. As with real juggling, you can try again. Hit RESET, type in a new value, and press GO.

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Exercise 2: Two balls with one hand</div>
	Now we add a second ball. Because a hand cannot catch and throw at the same instant, you must stagger the throws and catches.
	</br></br>
	When juggling two balls with one hand, you should throw the second ball approximately when the first ball is at the peak of its flight.
	</br></br>
	Later, when you juggle three balls, we will help you determine the correct timing of the throws.
	</br></br>
	Your challenge in this exercise is to juggle two balls with one hand. As in Exercise 1, you will assign an upward velocity to the balls so each hangs in the air for 1.4 seconds.
	</br></br>
	In this exercise you must also specify a time interval between throws, in seconds. <b>This time is equal to the time it takes for one ball to rise from the juggler’s hand to the peak of its flight</b>. 
	</br></br>
	Firing horizontally means that you set the cannon’s initial horizontal velocity. The cannonball will have zero vertical velocity when it leaves the mouth of the cannon.

If you specify the correct time, the juggler will throw the second ball precisely when the first ball is at the peak. You can also check your answer using the stopwatch in the control panel.
	</br></br>
	Changing the interval between tosses affects the spacing between the balls. You can successfully keep the balls in the air with a wide range of interval values, but the juggling will look most polished when you have the right interval.

	<div class="pLabQASection">

	</br></br>
	In this exercise, you will specify the same two values as in Exercise 2: the vertical, or y, component of velocity and the time interval between throws.

	The distance between the juggler's hands is 0.70 meters.

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Exercise 4: The amazing juggler</div>
	You are ready to juggle!
	</br></br>
	Juggling three balls is not much different than juggling two. Again, you will specify the initial y velocity, the initial x velocity, and the time delay between throws.
	</br></br>
	As before, you want to throw each ball into the air for 1.4 seconds, during which time each ball will move through a horizontal displacement of 0.70 meters.
	</br></br>
	In juggling three or more objects, there is a formula for calculating the correct time interval between throws so that your virtual juggling looks as polished as the real thing. First, determine the time it takes for a single ball to leave one hand, rise and fall to the other hand, and then rise and fall back to the starting hand (in other words, double the hang time). Second, divide this round trip time by the number of objects being juggled. The result is the desired time interval between throws.
	</br></br>
	Example: Suppose you want to juggle three balls so that each one has a hang time of 2.0 seconds. Each ball would take 4.0 seconds to complete a round trip, a total of 2.0 seconds to go up from the first hand and down to the second, then another 2.0 seconds to make the return trip.
	</br></br>
	The time delay between throws then would be 4.0 seconds divided by 3, which is 1 1/3 seconds. In other words, when juggling three balls, the second ball should be thrown a little after the first ball has passed the peak of its arc. (You will use this formula again later when attempting to juggle five chainsaws!)
	</br></br>
	<div class="pLabQASection">
		Give juggling three balls a try. Each ball should have a hang time of 1.4 seconds. Specify an initial y velocity and an initial x velocity so that each ball travels 0.70 m horizontally during its flight time. Also specify a time interval between throws using the input gauges in the control panel.
		</br></br>
		Then press GO and amaze your friends!
		</br></br>
		The computer will automatically program the second hand, using your specified values, to throw the balls back to the beginning hand. If you get the time interval correct, a ball will be released just when the prior ball is starting to fall toward the other hand. Your juggling will look as smooth and polished as a professional’s.
		</br></br>
		Once you have successfully juggled three balls, try juggling higher or lower by varying the initial y velocity. Here's something to think about: If you increase the initial y velocity, will the initial x velocity required for the juggler to catch the balls with the other hand increase, decrease or stay the same? Why?

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Exercise 6: Throwing angle</div>
	Until now, you have specified the x and y components of the velocity to get your juggler to throw the ball from one hand to another.
	</br></br>
	There is another way to describe the projectile motion of juggling balls: by specifying the initial speed of each ball (the magnitude v of its velocity), and a throwing angle θ for each ball relative to the horizontal axis.
	</br></br>
	The vertical, or y, component of velocity is related to the speed and angle by this equation:
	</br></br>
	<img src= "course/labs/Motion_in_two_dimensions_2/assets/image60.gif">
	</br></br>
	And the horizontal, or x, velocity, by this equation:
	</br></br>
	<img src= "course/labs/Motion_in_two_dimensions_2/assets/image61.gif">
	</br></br>
	These three quantities, vy,vx,and v, form a right triangle and are related by the Pythagorean theorem. The components are the legs of the triangle and the velocity is the hypotenuse.

		Determine the answers to the above question and then try them in the simulation. This is precision juggling: You must specify the speed and time interval to the nearest hundredth and the angle to the nearest tenth of a degree.
		</br></br>
		You can set the magnitude and direction of the velocity in the simulation by clicking and dragging the orange velocity vector which you also see in the diagram above. In the control panel, you will see two input gauges that describe to the length and direction of this orange vector. The first is marked "Initial speed," and it controls the initial speed for each ball. The second is marked "Angle," and it controls the angle at which the juggler throws the balls.
		</br></br>
		You can fine tune these values using the up/down buttons in the control panel.
		</br></br>
		The final gauge is for specifying the time interval between throws. You can calculate this by doubling the hang time and dividing by the number of balls (in this case, three).

	The goal is to juggle five chainsaws; you can throw them to any height you like. The juggler's hands are 1.40 meters apart. Again, you pick a speed and throwing angle to send the chainsaws into the air so that they land in the juggler’s other hand.
	</br></br>
	A variation here is that you are now trying to juggle five objects, not three. To determine the time interval between throws, double the hang time and divide by five. 
	</br></br>
	<div class="pLabQASection">
		Give it a try in the simulation.
		</br></br>
		Pick a height you wish to juggle to (or alternatively, a time you wish each chainsaw to remain in the air). Use that value to calculate a throwing speed and throwing angle relative to the x axis. Remember, whatever you pick for the initial y component of velocity will affect the value of the x velocity required to move the chainsaws 1.40 m horizontally to the other hand in the right amount of time.
		</br></br>
		Also determine the time interval between throws. HINT: Now that you are juggling five objects, the time interval between throws must be shorter than it was for three objects.

	Everything you just learned applies in real life. You can take what you just experienced and juggle real balls.
	</br></br>
	Try it. Start with a single ball. Juggle it with one hand, throwing to the same height every time. This is important. If you do not throw the ball to roughly the same height every time, juggling three balls will be extremely difficult.
	</br></br>
	Now try two balls with one hand. Think about the time interval between throws, and practice throwing each ball to the same height.
	</br></br>
	Next, try two balls with two hands. Keep everything the same, except impart some horizontal velocity to the balls as you throw them. You can see and feel how the vertical and horizontal velocity components of the balls are independent. (We are not making this stuff up!) It is very important that the balls always rise to the same height and always travel roughly the same horizontal distance.
	</br></br>
	Finally, add a third ball. Pick a hand to start with, say, your right. Put two balls in your right hand and one in your left.
	</br></br>
	Throw the first ball up, from the right to the left hand. When it reaches its peak − or better yet, just a bit after − throw the second ball up with your left hand to your right hand. Just after the second ball reaches its peak, throw the third ball with your right hand to your left hand. Meanwhile, remember to catch the balls that come down!
	</br></br>
	Have patience. That and a little physics knowledge is all you need to become a juggler.
