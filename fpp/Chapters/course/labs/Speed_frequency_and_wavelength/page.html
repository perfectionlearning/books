	Mechanical waves are disturbances in a medium that carry energy from place to place. They are caused by vibrations. These vibrations range from the small − the quivering of your vocal cords as you whisper to a friend − to the enormous, such as seismic vibrations in the Earth that can cause 30-meter-tall waves in the ocean. In this lab, you will study some of the fundamental principles of mechanical waves by studying a wave on a wire.

	</br>
	Imagine you are bird − a claustrophobic bird. You like to have room to spread your wings. Sometimes it gets crowded up on those telephone wires.
	</br></br>
	All you want is to enjoy your favorite stretch of wire, but it is filled with other birds. So you hope to knock them off. With a wave.

	</figure>
	</br>
	You are the red parrot sitting on the wire nearest to the pole. You want to knock the other birds off the wire. You will create a wave pulse in the wire by jiggling it. Each time you yank it up and push it down, you create a wave pulse that will, you hope, dislodge some of your rivals. 
	</br></br>
	Some of them may get annoyed and fly off at the slightest disturbance. Others are more stubborn. You will have to make waves with a variety of heights to knock them all off. The height of a wave − its maximum positive displacement from the equilibrium, or rest, position − is called its <b>amplitude</b>. It is often easiest to calculate the displacement by noting the height of a wave peak above the rest point of the wire. 
	</br></br>
	<div class="pLabQASection">
		</br>
		Open the simulation. Press GO to create a wave pulse in the wire. At any time you can press PAUSE to freeze the wave. Pressing PAUSE again will restart the action. Press RESET to start over.
		</br></br>
		There is a grid in the simulation that will prove useful in answering various questions. Each side of a square that makes up the grid is 0.25 m. 
		</br></br>
		If that first wave pulse did not knock the birds off the wire, you can vary the wave’s amplitude, using the up-down button on the control panel. Use the arrows in the simulation to set the amplitude. Press GO to send another wave pulse down the wire. As you create wave pulses in the wire, note their direction of travel. Also, consider whether the wire itself travels left or right.

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Exercise 2: Continuous waves</div>
	</br>
	In Exercise 1, you created a single wave pulse by pushing and pulling the wire perpendicular to the direction along which the wave pulse then traveled.
	</br></br>
	You created a <b>transverse wave pulse</b> − a wave pulse in which the particles of the medium vibrate perpendicular to the direction the wave pulse travels. The bird pushed and pulled the particles of the telephone wire up and down vertically, while the wave traveled horizontally to the right. The particles that make up the wire move up and down as a wave pulse passes through their location, but they (and the wire) do not move in the direction of the wave pulse. (We are helping you answer some questions asked earlier, but these are crucial points.)
	</br></br>
	Now, some of the birds have gotten wise to your ways. Some of them will hang on no matter how tall you make the wave on the wire.
	</br></br>
	You need another way to knock them off. How about causing the wire to vibrate, or oscillate, at different rates? Instead of sending down a single wave pulse, you will create a continuous wave.
	</br></br>

		<figcaption style="font-family: AvenirNextLTPro-Demi;">Exercise 2. Oscillate the wire at different frequencies to dislodge the birds.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	</br>
	In this exercise, you can make the wave as tall as you want by varying the amplitude, as in Exercise 1. Now you can also alter its frequency. The number of complete cycles per second is the <b>frequency</b>. By complete cycles per second, we mean how many times per second you pull the wire up from equilibrium, push it down and then pull it back to its starting point. A common unit for the frequency is the hertz (Hz); one Hz equals one cycle per second. 
	</br></br>
	Experiment with changing both the amplitude and the frequency at which you cause the wire to vibrate. See if you can knock all the birds off. Also use the simulation to answer the question below. 
	</br></br>
	<div class="pLabQASection">
		Create a wave by choosing its amplitude, in meters, and its frequency, in hertz (Hz). After assigning some values, press GO to start the wave. Observe that wave, and then change the wave by changing either its amplitude or frequency − you can do so by clicking the buttons as the simulation runs. 
		</br></br>
		At any time, PAUSE freezes the wave. Press PAUSE a second time to restart the action. Press RESET if you want to start over from the beginning.

<div class="pExerciseContainer">
	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Exercise 3: Wavelength</div>
	</br>
	So far, you have varied the amplitude and frequency of a wave.
	</br></br>
	You may have noticed that as you changed the frequency of your vibrations, the distance between the peaks of the wave also changed. 
	</br></br>
	The <b>wavelength</b> of a wave can be measured by determining the distance between two adjacent peaks. 
	</br></br>
	<img src= "course/labs/Speed_frequency_and_wavelength/assets/image10.jpg"><figcaption style="font-family: AvenirNextLTPro-Demi;">Figure 1. Wavelength.</figcaption>
	</br></br>
	In general, the wavelength of a transverse wave is the distance between two adjacent points with the same displacement and at the same part of a wave cycle. For instance, the wavelength is also the distance between two points where the wave is at equilibrium but is rising. (All of this is to say: do not measure wavelength by noting adjacent points where the wave is at equilibrium, since that is one-half a wavelength. If you look at the diagram, you will see what we mean.) 
	</br></br>
	Wavelength is expressed in units of length, often meters.
	</br></br>
	Changing the frequency of a wave in the wire also changes the wavelength of the wave.
	</br></br>
	Consider the next exercise, pictured below.
	</br></br>
	<figure style="padding-top:20px;padding-bottom:10px;">
		<img class="pExcersiseThumb" src="course/labs/Speed_frequency_and_wavelength/assets/Ex_03_Wavelength1.png" style="width:70%;"/>
		</br></br>
		<figcaption style="font-family: AvenirNextLTPro-Demi;">Exercise 3. Use wavelength to dislodge the birds.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	</br>
	Now some hummingbirds have arrived, and they have coordinated their efforts. They are sitting one meter apart, and the only way they will fly off is if you vibrate the wire so that each bird is at a peak of the wave at precisely the same moment. Each grid square in the figure shown above has a length of 0.25 meters. 
	</br></br>
	Put another way, you can dislodge the birds if you vibrate the wire so the wavelength of the wave equals one meter, which is the distance between birds (there are other correct answers, but this is the simplest one). 
	</br></br>
	Experiment with the frequency until you create a wave that meets these conditions − otherwise no birds will fly off.
	</br></br>
	Also use the simulation to answer the question below.
	</br>
	<div class="pLabQASection">
		Remember, GO starts the wave. PAUSE freezes the wave. (This is a particularly good exercise in which to use the PAUSE button because it permits you to see whether the peaks of the waves are reaching the hummingbirds at precisely the same instant.) Press RESET to start over. 
		</br></br>
		A good way to approach this exercise is to first observe how changing the frequency affects the wavelength of the wave. Then, use the PAUSE button to see whether the wavelength needs to be longer or shorter to achieve the goal of knocking the hummingbirds off the wire. Adjust the frequency accordingly. (The wire itself stays the same as you make these changes − it does not stretch nor does its tension change. These points hold true unless we tell you otherwise.) 
		</br></br>
		Note that when the red parrot changes the frequency with which it shakes the wire, it takes several seconds for the new wave to travel the length of the wire. You should wait a few seconds to see if your wave has the desired effect before trying a new wave. 
		</br></br>
		You are also asked a question below which asks you to state the relationship between frequency and wavelength.

		After you have knocked all the birds off the wire, return here to answer some follow-up questions.

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Exercise 4: Wave speed</div>
	</br>
	The speed at which the wave moves along the wire is called its <b>wave speed</b>.
	</br></br>
	To determine wave speed, you can measure how far one element of the wave − say a particular peak − moves to the right during an elapsed time.
	</br></br>
	Consider the next exercise, pictured below.

	Your challenge is to determine the speed of different waves traveling down the wire. You control the amplitude and frequency of the wave. The pterodactyl is perched 2.5 meters away from the red parrot, a fact that will enable you to calculate the speed of the wave in the wire. 
	</br></br>
	(You cannot knock this prehistoric reptile off the wire, so you have decided to use him to collect data that will help you knock other pesky birds off later.) 
	</br></br>
	<div class="pLabQASection">
		When you set the amplitude and frequency and press GO, the wave will travel down the wire. The distance from the red parrot to the pterodactyl is 2.5 meters. By determining how long it takes for a wave to reach the pterodactyl, you can calculate the wave's speed.

		Use the stopwatch in the control panel to determine how long it takes the wave to travel from the red parrot along the wire to the pterodactyl.

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Exercise 5: Frequency and wavelength</div>
	</br>
	You measured time and distance to determine the speed of the wave in Exercise 4. Wave speed also can be determined using two fundamental properties of a wave − its frequency and wavelength.
	</br></br>
	Frequency is:
	</br></br>
	<img src= "course/labs/Speed_frequency_and_wavelength/assets/image11.gif">
	</br></br>
	Wavelength is:
	</br></br>
	<img src= "course/labs/Speed_frequency_and_wavelength/assets/image12.gif">
	</br></br>
	To understand the above formula for wavelength, consider a wave pulse. It starts as a peak, becomes a trough, and then returns to a peak. It completes one wave cycle in one wavelength of motion. 
	</br></br>
	By multiplying frequency and wavelength, we create an equation for wave speed:
	</br></br>
	<img src= "course/labs/Speed_frequency_and_wavelength/assets/image13.gif">
	</br></br>
	If you can determine the frequency and wavelength of a wave, you can determine the wave speed.
