<div class="pLabPageIntro">
	When light passes from one transparent substance into another, it often changes directions at the surface separating the two substances. Light often bends, for example, when it passes from air to water, or water to glass, or glass back to air. This is called refraction. 
	</br></br>
	How light moves when it passes from one substance to another is the subject of this lab exercise.
	</br></br>
	You command a fleet of helicopter gunships, firing lasers at a submarine fleet lurking below. Sometimes the submarines are in water; sometimes they are in an unidentified goop. You know where the submarines are, but can you hit them? 
	</br></br>
	Use your knowledge of refraction and reflection to precisely hit the submarines − before they hit you.

	</br>
	If someone shines a laser beam through air toward you across an unobstructed room, you might correctly guess the light follows a straight path to reach you. 
	</br></br>
	But what if the light passes through something else on the way − such as water, or glass, or oil? Sometimes the passing of light from one substance to another can cause the light ray to change direction. 
	</br></br>
	We will call a substance a medium (plural, media). The layer between media is called an interface. Light passes from one medium to another, crossing the interface between the media as it does so.
	</br></br>
	Let's explore what happens when light passes from air to water and vice versa. Consider the simulation pictured below:

		In this simulation, you control the helicopters’ lasers. Fire lasers from any of the helicopters to try to hit any of the submarines lurking in the water below.

		You will record no data. Just experiment with firing the lasers at different angles into the water, observe what happens and answer the question below.

		You aim the laser for each helicopter by clicking on the arrow and pointing it with your mouse. Once you have selected a direction for your shot, hit FIRE and watch the action.

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Exercise 2: Speed of light</div>
	</br>
	Why does light often bend when it passes into the water from the air? You may have noticed in the first exercise that the laser beam travels at a different speed in the water than in the air. This speed change has something to do with making the light ray bend, and you will explore this more in the following exercise.
	</br></br>
	Consider the setup pictured below:

	</br>
	The goal is the same as before − to hit the submarines with laser shots before they hit you. Only now the submarines are not lurking in water, but different media. The media are labeled 1, 2, and 3 as shown in the diagram above. 
	</br></br>
	<div class="pLabQASection">
		In the simulation, you can only shoot at submarines confined in the same box as your helicopter. Start with any of the three helicopters, click and maneuver the aiming arrow as before, and then press FIRE when you are ready to blast away.

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Exercise 3: Angle of refraction</div>
	</br>
	You saw that as light changes speed from one medium to another, it can change direction.
	</br></br>
	You may also have noticed that the angle at which light strikes the interface between the two media plays a role in the bending of light. If the light is perpendicular to this interface, then the light does not bend at all, regardless of how much its speed changes. However, if the light strikes at an angle, it changes direction.
	</br></br>
	In summary, light may bend when it passes from one medium to another if two conditions are met:
	</br></br>
	<ul style='list-style-type:disc;padding-left: 18px;'>
		<li>The speed of the light differs in the media</li>
		<li>The light strikes the interface at any angle that is not perpendicular (“normal”) to the interface</li>
	</ul>
	</br></br>
	This phenomenon is called <b>refraction</b>. 
	</br></br>
	The light ray in the first medium − in this diagram, the air − is called the <b>incident ray</b>. The light ray in the second medium − the water − is called the <b>>refracted ray</b>.
	</br></br>
	The surface separating the two media is the interface. Perpendicular to the interface at the point where the ray strikes the interface is the <b> normal line </b>. Normal is a mathematical term for perpendicular. 
	</br></br>
	<img src= "course/labs/Refraction/assets/image41.gif">
	</br></br>
	The <b>angle of incidence</b>is the angle between the incident ray and the normal line. The angle between the refracted ray and the normal line is called the <b>angle of refraction</b>. These angles are measured relative to the normal line, not the interface. In this lab, we focus on refraction, but as the diagram shows, some of the light can reflect as well. 
	</br></br>
	Let's explore these terms in the simulation pictured below:

<div class="pExerciseContainer">
	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Exercise 4: Snell’s law</div>
	</br>
	Instead of guessing where you aim your laser, would it not be better if you could calculate exactly where your light ray is going to go? 
	</br></br>
	You can, with the help of a physics principle called Snell's law (named after the Dutch mathematician, Willebrord Snell, who discovered it about 400 years ago). 
	</br></br>
	<img src= "course/labs/Refraction/assets/image42.gif">
	</br></br>
	Snell’s law relates the indices of refraction n<sub>1</sub> and n<sub>2</sub> of two materials, with the angles the light forms with the normal line as it passes from one medium to the other. 
	</br></br>
	Snell’s law quantifies the key principles you have experienced in this lab: that light passing from one medium to another will change direction if it changes speeds and if it crosses the interface at an angle relative to the normal other than 0°.
	</br></br>
	There is a caveat here: The light can also reflect at the interface. You will experiment more with this shortly.
	</br></br>
	You can see that Snell's law involves four variables: n<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub>, the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction. Remember, these angles are measured relative to the normal line, not the interface. 
	</br></br>
	If you know three of these values, you can solve for the fourth.
	</br></br>
	Now consider the next simulation, pictured below:
	</br></br>
	<figure style="padding-top:20px;padding-bottom:10px;">
		<img class="pExcersiseThumb" src="course/labs/Refraction/assets/Ex_05_Snells law1.png" style="width:70%;"/>
		</br></br>
		<figcaption style="font-family: AvenirNextLTPro-Demi;">Exercise 4. Use Snell’s law to pinpoint the submarines exactly.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	</br>
	You control the helicopter, and you are outnumbered three to one by submarines lurking in the water. But it does not matter that you are outgunned − now you can use Snell's law to hit the submarines exactly every time. 
	</br></br>
	When you click on the helicopter's aiming arrow, the angle of refraction needed to hit each of the submarines will appear on the screen, as illustrated above. 
	</br></br>
	Consider this your Snell's radar. You can use this angle of refraction, along with n<sub>>1</sub> and n<sub>2</sub> to calculate the angle of incidence. 
	</br></br>
	When you have calculated your aiming angles, simply drag the aiming arrow around until the box on the control panel reads the correct angle of incidence. Then fire away. 
	</br></br>
	You must do your calculations carefully − the submarine captains have gotten much better with practice!

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Exercise 5: Total internal reflection</div>
	</br>
	You may have noticed in these exercises that sometimes the submarines fire a laser beam and it never leaves the water. Instead, the light ray reflects back into the water.
	</br></br>
	What is going on?
	</br></br>
	This is called <b>total internal reflection</b>, and it only occurs when light traveling in a higher index of refraction material attempts to pass into a lower index of refraction material. The light also must strike the interface with a large enough angle of incidence. 
	</br></br>
	Using Snell's law, you can calculate what minimum angle of incidence will cause total internal reflection.
	</br></br>
	Look at the diagram to the right. You know that when light shines up out of the water into air, a faster medium, the refracted beam bends away from the normal according to Snell's law. 
	</br></br>
	<img src= "course/labs/Refraction/assets/image43.gif">
	</br></br>
	There is a point at which the angle of refraction in the air − θ<sub>2</sub> − reaches 90°. At this point, the light never leaves the water.
	</br></br>
	This angle of incidence is known as the critical angle − marked in the diagram as θc. 
	</br></br>
	If light strikes the interface with any incident angle greater than the critical angle, θc, then the light ray will be reflected in total back into the water. 
	</br></br>
	Because we know the critical angle is defined by the case where the angle of refraction is equal to 90°, we can solve for the critical angle provided we know the refractive indices of the two materials involved.
	</br></br>
	Consider Snell's law for two media. The light travels in the different media at different speeds.
	</br></br>
	<img src= "course/labs/Refraction/assets/image44.gif">
	</br></br>
	where
	</br></br>
	n<sub>slow</sub> is greater than n<sub>fast</sub> and the angle of refraction in the fast medium, θ<sub>2</sub>, is equal to 90 degrees (the beam is refracted along the interface line). 
	</br></br>
	Setting θ<sub>2</sub>= 90°, and solving for θ<sub>1</sub>, now renamed θcritical, we find 
	</br></br>
	<img src= "course/labs/Refraction/assets/image45.gif">
	</br></br>
	Because sin 90° = 1, the critical angle equation is:
	</br></br>
	<img src= "course/labs/Refraction/assets/image46.gif">
	</br></br>
	The critical angle is obtained by taking the arcsine:
	</br></br>
	<img src= "course/labs/Refraction/assets/image47.gif">
	</br></br>
	Note that if light is passing from the fast medium into the slow medium, then it bends toward the normal. In this case, there is no total internal reflection possible. 
	</br></br>
	With the critical angle equation in mind, consider the simulation pictured below:
	</br></br>
