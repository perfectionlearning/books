<!-- <div class="pActivityHeader">Force between charge particles</div> -->
<div class="pLabPageIntro">
	Charged objects can exert forces on other charged objects without direct contact. The electric force is one of the fundamental forces in the universe, and examples of it may be found literally everywhere, from televisions where electrically charged plates steer beams of electrons to strike the screen, to the interior of atoms where the electric attraction between the positive nucleus and the negative electrons helps to hold them together.
	</br></br>
	As with other forces, an electric force has both strength (magnitude) and direction. The amount of electrostatic force between two charged particles depends on the strength of the charges and on the distance between them, and the direction of the force is determined by their positions and the sign of their charges.
	</br></br>
	After your initial work on charges, it will be time for some play. You will take a trip to a miniature electric golf course.
</div>
<div class="pExerciseContainer">
	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Exercise 1: Sign and direction of force</div>
	</br>
	You will start by using a simulation with two spheres that are electrically charged in order to see how the direction of the force between two charged particles depends on the signs of the charges. The basic setup of the simulation is shown below.
	</br></br>
	As you can see, the charged spheres are different colors. The force the blue charged sphere exerts on the orange charged sphere is shown with a blue arrow. The force the orange sphere exerts on the blue sphere is shown with an orange arrow. The arrow points in the direction of the force. The longer the arrow, the greater the amount of the force.
	</br></br>
	You can see that the charged spheres repel each other. By repel, we mean the forces push them apart.

		Launch the simulation by clicking on the orange button labeled Exercise 1. After you launch it, set the amount of charge by using the up-down arrows next to the numbers. The amount of charge is a multiple of 10-12 coulombs, 0.00000000001 coulombs. Even though this seems like a small amount of charge, it would take millions of electrons or protons to create the amount of charge used in these simulations. 
		</br></br>
		Both charges start at zero, so if you press the up arrow at first, you create a positive number, and a positive charge. If you press the down arrow at first, you will have a negative number, which means you have created a negative charge.
		</br></br>
		Example: If you click <b>up</b> to a charge equaling “4,” then you have loaded the sphere with a total <b>positive</b> charge of 4.0×10-12 coulombs. If you click <b>down</b> to a charge of “−5,” then you have loaded the sphere with <b>negative</b> 5.0×10-12 coulombs.

		Drag out the charges. Change their signs to positive and negative to answer the questions below.

	To determine the relationship between the amount of force one charge exerts on the other and the distance between these charges, you will need to record data.

	<div class="pLabQASection">
		After you launch the simulation, drag the two large charged spheres from the control panel to the area above.

		Get a variety of distances. For instance, about 1 grid box apart, then 3 grid boxes apart, then 5, 7 and 9. You will find it useful to record your distances and forces in scientific notation.

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Exercise 3: How the charge values affect the force </div>
	</br>
	You learned how the amount of electric force depends on the distance between the charges. Did you conclude that the electric force should get weaker with distance? Perhaps you thought about what would happen if the electric force got <b>stronger</b> with distance. It would be a strange universe indeed − for example, the flight paths of electrons in your TV set would be affected more by your neighbor’s TV set than your own! Or, in this case, two charges on opposite sides of the galaxy would exert incredible amounts of force on one another.
	</br></br>
	Alternatively, you may have turned to your everyday experience to answer the question. For example, when you take out two laundry items fresh from the dryer that want to stick together (the dreaded “static cling”), separating the two pieces reduces their attractive force.
	</br></br>
	In this exercise, you will investigate what happens to the amount of force when the amount of one change changes. For example, what happens if the amount of one charge doubles? Triples?
	</br></br>
	To do so, you will proceed in a fashion very similar to the one you used to determine the relationship of force and distance. You will set the charges, record the value for the force, and then change the value of one charge, and again record the force. 
	</br></br>
	To do this, you will change the value of one charge at a time. The data table below assumes you hold one charge constant and vary the other. You will record the data, and then answer the same question as before. Is the force proportional to q1? Or is the force inversely proportional, and so on.

	</br>
	After golfing legend Bobby Jones watched Jack Nicklaus demolish the competition at the Masters tournament in 1965, he uttered the famous quip, “He plays a game with which I am not familiar.” Well, today, you will play a game with which even Nicklaus himself is unfamiliar: electric golf. 
	</br></br>
	In the next several exercises, you will use the electric force on a charged golf ball to move it around a course. The greater the force, the faster the ball moves initially. By the end, you may be so skilled at calibrating this force that you can score a hole-in-one every time! 
	</br></br>
	The putter is unique − it is a massive wand that you load with charge. You load the club head with positively charged protons or negatively-charged electrons. A proton has a charge of <b>positive</b> 1.6 x 10<sup>−19</sup> coulombs. An electron has a charge of <b>negative</b> 1.6×10<sup>−19</sup> coulombs. The golf ball has a net charge equal to the charge of one proton.

		<figcaption style="font-family: AvenirNextLTPro-Demi;">Exercise 4. Putt the charged golf ball into the cup using your charged putter.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	As you load the very massive club head with charge, the putter and ball immediately exert forces on each other. (The vector arrow shown above indicates the direction and magnitude of the force of the putter on the ball; we do not display the equal but opposite force on the putter.) The ball will stay “frozen” in place until you push the PUTT button in the simulation. 
	</br></br>
	This golf course has friction, which causes the ball to slow and roll to a stop. When you push PUTT, the ball will move across the course. Its acceleration (and velocity) will depend on the amount and direction of the net force on it. After the ball stops moving, the ball again is frozen in place, which allows you to set up for your next shot. Otherwise, the ball would begin to move as you increased the charge in the putter, or moved the putter closer to the ball. You press PUTT when you are ready to take your next shot. 
	</br></br>

	<div class="pLabQASection">
		This first exercise is just for practice. Do not worry about exactly how much force the putter exerts on the golf ball. Use trial and error to sink the ball. You will make more precise calculations later.
		</br></br>
		On this first practice green, the putter is positioned a fixed distance from the ball. Your challenge is to get the ball to move across the green − hopefully into the cup − by loading the putter with charges. You will only get one putt, so if the putt doesn’t drop, press RESET and try again. (For extra fun, you can try scoring a hole-in-one after a rebound from the back wall.)

	For this hole, if the putter exerts an initial force of <b>8.2×10<sup>−26</sup> newtons</b> on the charged ball, the ball will plop precisely into the cup. Trust us. 
	</br></br>
	If the initial force is lower than this figure, the ball will stop short of the hole. If the initial force is higher, the ball will overshoot the hole and fall into the water trap, taking your hopes and dreams with it. 
	</br></br>
	The challenge is to use Coulomb’s law and program the putter to impart exactly the right amount of initial force on the ball. You set both the charge on the putter and the distance between the charged putter and the charged ball.
	</br></br>
	HINT: It may be easier to pick a value for the amount of charge, and then calculate the distance. As before, the amount of putter charge must be in increments of the charge of a proton.

	Now that you have graduated from Q-school, you are ready for the masters. You are playing solely for pride, and love of physics - there are no monetary rewards. In fact, there will even be a charge to play (1.6×10<sup>−19</sup> coulombs, to be exact). Please mail in one proton to us. 
	</br></br>
	As before, you set the amount of charge on the putter and you can move the charged putter closer to or farther away from the charged proton ball. In addition, you can now rotate the golfer to aim the ball. A gauge in the control panel displays how far the putter is from the ball. 
	</br></br>
	For an extra challenge, some of the courses are dotted with clumps of positive and negative charges, marked with plus signs or minus signs. The amount of charge on the obstacles is indicated. You will find that your proton ball has a very strong reaction to these clumps of charges, sometimes from a great distance away! 
	</br></br>
	All the obstacles are point charges. The shape of an obstacle − like a sand trap − is intended to give you a visual image only. The amount of charge in an obstacle is quantified as a multiple of e, the elementary charge. The elementary charge equals 1.6×10<sup>−19</sup> C, the magnitude of charge of a proton or an electron. 
	</br></br>
	There also are hills. Again, the outline of the hill is just a visual metaphor, not a precise depiction of the forces. When you press GO, the ball will be released, and propelled from the charged putter to move under the influence of friction, the putter, and any other electric forces that act on it.

	Once the ball comes to a stop, it is held in place so you can click and drag the putter over to the ball for your next stroke. Position the putter, enter a new value for its charge if you wish, then press PUTT. You can keep putting until you get the ball in the cup. 
	</br></br>
	To summarize the physics, you change the force you exert on the charged ball by:
	</br></br>
	<ul style= "list-style-type:disc;padding-left: 18px;"><li>Changing the amount and sign of the charge on the putter.</li></ul>
	</br>
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc;padding-left: 18px;"><li>Changing the distance between putter and ball.</li></ul>
	</br>
	You can aim your shots by changing the angle between the putter and the ball.
	</br></br>
	So go play! Try to complete a five-hole course in the fewest number of strokes. A stroke counter will keep track of your progress across all the holes.

		The simulation link buttons below lead you to five different miniature golf holes.

		To assist you with the diabolical charged sandtraps and hills, some holes show electric field lines. If you have not yet studied electric fields, the instructions that follow may be a little cryptic, but will serve as an introduction to the topic. The electric field shown is created by the charged obstacles. These lines provide a visual outline of the overall electric field caused by the multiple charged obstacles. The field lines point in the direction of the net electric field created by the obstacles. The closer together they are, the stronger the field. The force on the golf ball equals its net charge times the electric field. For a positive charge, the electric field points in the same direction as the force. In sum, if you see a group of field lines closely clustered, you should expect your golf ball to experience a strong force there, roughly in the direction of those field lines. 
		</br></br>
		You can use the field lines in a manner analogous to how a real golfer reads the rise and fall of a green to determine where and how hard to putt the ball. Take advantage of the field lines to predict how the charged golf ball will behave as it moves across the green. 
		</br></br>
		For the scorecard to work, you must play and complete the first hole first. If you play the first hole a second time, we assume you are playing a new round (starting over). To go on to a subsequent hole, hit “Next hole” after you have sunk your putt. You can play any hole by clicking on the appropriate button below. 
		</br></br>
		You can also replay any hole you like by pushing the RESET button while playing that hole. Pressing RESET returns the ball to its initial point and clears the stroke counter to zero for that hole. Pressing RESET does not restart the course, just that hole.
