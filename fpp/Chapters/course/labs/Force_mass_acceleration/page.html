<div class="pLabPageIntro">
	A net force causes an object to accelerate. In this lab, you will apply this principle to fly a helicopter.
	</br></br>
	Flying a helicopter is also an exercise in balancing forces. For example, when a helicopter is hovering motionless in the air, the sum of all the forces acting on the helicopter is zero. The force of gravity pulls down on the helicopter while an equal but opposite force generated by the spinning rotor blades pushes the helicopter up.
	</br></br>
	When the net force acting on a body equals zero, it is in equilibrium. This does not necessarily mean it is stationary − a helicopter flying at a constant velocity is also in equilibrium, since it is not accelerating. Helicopter pilots place their craft in equilibrium both to hover, and to maintain a constant speed and direction.
	</br></br>
	In this lab, you are the pilot of a helicopter. Your mission is to guide the helicopter safely through a series of missions. You will do so by using your knowledge of <b>forces</b>, <b>Newton’s laws</b> and the <b>concept of equilibrium.</b>
	</br></br>
	(In this lab, we consider only translational − linear − motion. We ignore any torques which could cause the helicopter to have rotational acceleration. Torque and rotational motion are outside the scope of the lab.)

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Exercise 1: Going airborne</div>
	</br>
	In the simulation for this first exercise, you can attempt some of the basic tasks required of a helicopter pilot. To do so, you control the <b>net</b> force upward on the helicopter. When the helicopter is in the air, the net force equals the positive lift force, which points up, plus its negative weight, which points down. (The lift force is caused by the interaction of the spinning blades with the air, and is used to propel the helicopter upward.) Throughout this lab, the upward direction is positive and the downward direction is negative. The net force, like all forces, is measured in newtons (N).
	</br></br>
	When the helicopter is in the air, you can set the net force to positive, negative, or zero values. The net force is negative when the magnitude of the helicopter’s lift force is less than its weight, except for when it is on the ground. When it is on the ground, there cannot be a negative net force because the normal force from the ground opposes the downward force of the helicopter’s weight and does not allow the helicopter to sink below the Earth’s surface.

	</br></br>
	To start, apply a positive net force to cause the helicopter to rise off the ground. Next, attempt to have the helicopter reach a constant vertical velocity. For an optional challenge, have it hover at a constant height of 15 meters, and finally, attempt to land (not crash) the helicopter.
	</br></br>
	Once in the air, you may find that controlling the craft is a little trickier than you anticipated − it may act a little skittish. Welcome to (a) the difficulties of flying a helicopter and (b) Newton’s world.
	</br></br>
	Here are a few hints: Start slowly! Initially, just use small net forces. You can look at the acceleration gauge to see in which direction you are accelerating. Try to keep your acceleration initially between plus or minus 0.25 m/s<sup>2</sup>.

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Exercise 2: What is the mass of the helicopter? </div>
	</br>
	In later exercises, you will need to know the mass and weight of your helicopter. In this exercise, you want to determine its mass. To do so, you will use Newton’s second law, <b>∑F = ma</b>. This law states that the sum of the forces on an object, which is the net force, equals the mass times the acceleration. Both force and acceleration are vectors, and the acceleration is in the same direction as the net force.
	</br></br>
	The helicopter has the same controls as before. The acceleration gauge will prove highly useful in this exercise. Apply a net force of 2000 N to the helicopter and observe its acceleration. Using this data, you can apply Newton’s second law and determine the helicopter’s mass.

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Exercise 3: Net force and acceleration</div>
	</br>
	So far, you have been controlling the vertical acceleration of the helicopter by setting the net force on the helicopter. Life is about to get a little more complicated.
	</br></br>
	First, controlling the helicopter now takes a little more intellectual effort. You now set the lift force, and have to use that force to determine the net vertical force acting on the helicopter. As stated earlier, the lift is the upward force caused by the helicopter’s rotors. The weight of the helicopter pulls it down. Since you calculated the mass, you can determine the helicopter’s weight by multiplying its mass by <i>g</i>, 9.80 m/s<sup>2</sup>.
	</br></br>
	<img src= "course/labs/Force_mass_acceleration/assets/image51.gif">
	</br></br>
	<b>Figure 1. The vertical forces acting on the helicopter</b>
	</br></br>
	The amount of weight equals mg, and the force is downward. We treat the lift force as positive since it is an upward force and the weight as negative since that force is downward. Figure 1 shows the vertical forces acting on the helicopter.
	</br></br>
	Second, and maybe we should have mentioned this first, your helicopter is plummeting toward the ground and will crash unless you do something about it. Bummer. Your co-pilot has fainted, but his words before passing out were: “If you can cause the helicopter to accelerate at 5.88 m/s<sup>2</sup>, we’re saved.” You trust him − he is a distinguished scientist, even if he does not react all that well to pressure. If you set that acceleration, the helicopter will land safely. If you err, it will crash into the ground, or fly off into space.
	</br></br>
	To solve the problem, you will have to know the helicopter’s mass. We hope you determined it correctly before, but since it is required to solve the problem, please click here to check your figure. If you made an error, it will cause problems for you in the rest of the lab.
	</br></br>
	<div class="pLabQASection">
		The helicopter starts 39.3 meters above the ground with a velocity of −21.5 m/s. We have paused the motion of the helicopter so you have a chance to set your controls before the helicopter crashes.

<div class="pExerciseContainer">
	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Exercise 4: Air resistance </div>
	</br>
	So far, we have ignored air resistance that would impede the helicopter’s progress. In this exercise, air resistance is now a factor in the simulation.
	</br></br>
	The purpose of this exercise is to use your helicopter to determine how the force of air resistance varies with the speed of the helicopter. Does the force of air resistance increase as the helicopter’s speed increases? Does it decrease? Does it stay the same? If it changes, what is the mathematical relationship between the two?
	</br></br>
	To answer these questions, you will fly the helicopter at different horizontal speeds. In the simulation, the helicopter will initially be hovering above the ground. Increase its thrust, and it will accelerate. However, with air resistance now acting on the helicopter, it will reach a particular velocity and stop accelerating.
	</br></br>
	Why does the helicopter cease to accelerate? For a given amount of thrust force, at a particular speed the force of air resistance balances the thrust force. This means there is no net force acting on the helicopter. The speed at which this occurs increases with the thrust force. This speed we will call terminal velocity (in principle, it should probably be called “terminal speed” since we are only considering magnitude, but terminal velocity is the more common term). The terminal velocity is a constant velocity at which the force of air resistance is equal to the force propelling an object. Here, you are experimenting with terminal velocity that occurs along the horizontal axis. Often terminal velocity is demonstrated with objects in free fall.
	</br></br>
	You can use the amount of thrust to measure how air resistance relates to speed. You are asked to graph the magnitude of the air resistance for at least three terminal helicopter speeds, and then interpret the graph to determine how air resistance relates to helicopter speed.
	</br></br>
	<div class="pLabQASection">
		There is no mission in this exercise other than collecting and interpreting data.
		</br></br>
		Fly the helicopter by applying thrust using the left and right arrow keys, and wait until it is moving at a constant horizontal velocity. You can tell whether it is moving at a constant horizontal velocity by looking at the horizontal velocity or acceleration gauge. Note: Have some patience! It may take 10 or 20 seconds before your helicopter reaches a constant velocity.
		</br></br>
		Using the helicopter’s gauges, determine the opposing force of air resistance for this helicopter speed. Remember, you can do this by relying on the fact that if the helicopter is moving at a constant horizontal velocity, then it is in equilibrium along that axis. Once you establish that the helicopter is in equilibrium, the horizontal thrust force of the helicopter is exactly balanced by the force of the air resistance. Write down the horizontal speed and the corresponding force of air resistance. Do this at least four times, noting your data each time.
		</br></br>
		For best results, try a wide variety of thrust forces (one that is quite low, one that is quite high, and a couple in the middle, for example).
		</br></br>
		When you are done, <b>graph</b> the helicopter’s velocity versus the force of air resistance on a separate sheet of paper. State the velocity, in m/s, on the y axis and the force of air resistance, in newtons, on the x axis.
		</br></br>
		Then, return here to answer some follow-up questions.

	</br>
	To fly a helicopter you need more than just vertical lift force − you need to be able to fly it forward and backward as well. In this exercise, you can also apply a horizontal force − called a <b>thrust force</b>.
	</br></br>
	Again your helicopter is sitting on the launch pad, as shown in the picture below. Your challenge in this exercise is to fly the helicopter from the left landing pad and land it − softly − on the second landing pad to the right. We have “turned off” air resistance once again, so you need not factor it into this exercise or the following one.

	</br></br>
	You continue to control the lift force by pressing the up and down arrow keys. You control the horizontal thrust force by pressing the right and left arrow keys.
	</br></br>
	Pressing the right arrow key adds 250 N of force directed horizontally to the right. Press the left arrow key, and 250 N of horizontal force is subtracted. A negative thrust is directed horizontally to the left.
	</br></br>
	The range of thrust force is −5000 N to +5000 N. A gauge on the control panel displays the total thrust force at any moment.
