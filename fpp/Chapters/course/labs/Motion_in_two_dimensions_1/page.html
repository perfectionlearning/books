	You may need to use one of the equations above, which describe one-dimensional motion with constant acceleration.
	</br></br>
	In applying these equations to this exercise, a is the rate of acceleration due to gravity. It is the constant rate at which objects accelerate near the Earth’s surface. Because the motion is in the vertical direction, we use Δ<i>y</i> to represent displacement. 
	</br></br>
	The acceleration a is given as a negative number because we use the convention that downward displacement is negative and upward displacement is positive. 
	</br></br>
	Throughout this lab, the effect of air resistance is ignored.

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Exercise 2: Firing a cannon horizontally</div>
	You can analyze the <b>velocity</b> of the cannonball you dropped in Exercise 1 in terms of its horizontal and vertical components. 
	</br></br>
	The cannon gave the cannonball zero horizontal velocity, which is why the cannonball dropped straight down.
	</br></br>
	The cannonball also had zero initial vertical velocity, but the magnitude of the vertical velocity increased as the ball fell.
	</br></br>
	The cannonball’s <b>acceleration</b> had horizontal and vertical components, too. It had zero horizontal acceleration (which, combined with zero horizontal velocity, explains why the cannon is not yet particularly useful, except for “welcoming” uninvited guests at the front door). 
	</br></br>
	The cannonball did have a vertical acceleration: It accelerated in the negative direction, toward the ground, at </br>a = −9.80 m/s<sup>2</sup>. The cannonball’s vertical acceleration was constant. 
	</br></br>
	The acceleration and velocity gauges in this lab are divided into vertical and horizontal components to help demonstrate these points. You can observe the vertical and horizontal velocity components as they change, or stay constant, over time. 
	</br></br>
	Now you get to fire a more useful cannon − one that supplies an initial horizontal velocity to the cannonball. Your goal is to hit the haystack at the 50-meter mark, as shown in the picture below.

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Exercise 3: Blast away!</div>
	Test your physics skills by firing against an opponent (such as a classmate), or by taking on the computer.
	</br></br>
	In this section, you must use your physics knowledge to calculate how to hit the opposing targets. As in Exercise 2, your cannon fires horizontally and you control only that velocity component. Your challenge is to calculate which firing velocity will hit the opponents’ targets before the opposing player, or the computer, destroys yours. 
	</br></br>
	<figure style="padding-top:20px;padding-bottom:10px;">

		<figcaption style="font-family: AvenirNextLTPro-Demi;">Exercise 3. Hit the opposing flag and drop a shot through the castle door.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	When calculating how to hit a target, it is helpful to think about what information you have at your disposal:
	</br></br>
	<ul style='list-style-type:disc;padding-left: 18px;'>
		<li>
		By looking at the distance scale, you know exactly where the targets lie along the x axis from the mouth of your cannon atop the tower. In the diagram above, the blue cannon on the left is trying to hit the red flag located 45 m away. The location of the flag will change when you restart the game. The other goal is to fire a cannonball through the door opening by aiming at the point 105 meters away. 
		</li>
		</br>
		<li>
		You know how much time it will take any cannonball to hit the ground (by observation from Exercises 1 and 2). The two towers are the same height. 
		</li>
	</ul>
	</br>
	Your challenge is to fire the cannonball with a velocity that will cause it to fly the horizontal displacement to a target in the time that it also drops vertically to the ground. 
	</br></br>
	You know how long it will take the cannonball to reach the ground, and how far away the targets are in the horizontal dimension. If you know displacement and time, can you determine velocity? The answer is yes! 
	<div class="pLabQASection">
		Test yourself in the simulation. You rule the blue-flagged castle and control the cannon on top of it. You can set the horizontal velocity of the cannonball by dragging the head of the vector arrow emanating from the cannon’s mouth, or by clicking the up and down buttons in the control panel. 
		</br></br>
		Either the computer or a classmate will run the cannon on top of the red-flagged castle. Whoever hits all the opposing targets first wins the game. The computer hits a target about two out of three times it fires. 
		</br></br>
		Each side is trying to hit two targets. The positions of these targets on the horizontal axis are marked by the triangle locaters that appear beneath the number line.

	In this exercise, you are starting your next stage of artillery training: shooting with a vertical velocity component. Your castle-top cannon has run out of cannonballs, and a battering ram is advancing to destroy your castle! 
	</br></br>
	Fortunately, you have another cannon on the ground, pointed straight up. If you can fire cannonballs to the top of the tower so that they arrive there with zero velocity, the gunner at the top can catch them and use them to fend off the advancing battering ram.

	You can shoot with any vertical velocity you want. The mouth of the cannon is at ground level.
	</br></br>
	What initial velocity must you choose so that the ball arrives at the top of the castle with zero velocity?

	Again, you may need one or more of the equations on the right.

		Now test your answer in the simulation. You control only the vertical velocity of the cannon. Your challenge is to propel the cannonball so that it reaches the peak of its flight at the same height as the top of the tower. At its peak, the cannonball’s velocity must equal zero for your comrade to be able to catch the cannonball. 
		</br></br>
		Enter an initial vertical velocity, in m/s, by dragging the head of the vector arrow or clicking the up and down buttons in the control panel. Press FIRE to try your shot. 
		</br></br>
		Each time you shoot, the battering ram gets closer to your castle!
		</br></br>
		After you have succeeded, press RESET. Now fire the cannonball at a velocity other than the correct answer, like 20.0 m/s. Record how long it takes for the cannonball to reach the peak of its motion and how long it takes to make the other half of the journey (back to the cannon mouth). It may prove effective to push PAUSE when the velocity equals 0.0 m/s in order to record the time at the peak. If you cannot pause the simulation exactly at a peak, consider recording a few data points and calculating an average percentage for the time spent traveling up, versus time spent traveling down. Even though this is a computerized lab, techniques used in traditional labs apply here. Also record the cannonball’s velocity at the end of its journey (the simulation pauses when the cannonball returns to the cannon).

	The cannonballs exit the cannons at ground level. To strike the enemy targets, you must set the initial horizontal and vertical velocity components for your cannonball. 
	</br></br>
	Think again about what determines the arc of your cannonball, and whether it will hit the target. The vertical velocity component determines how long the cannonball remains in the air (from Exercise 4). 
	</br></br>
	The horizontal velocity component determines the cannonball’s range (from Exercises 2 and 3).
	</br></br>
	You can calculate the combination of vertical and horizontal velocities needed to hit any target. Note: The cannon has a minimum vertical velocity of 35 m/s. 
	</br></br>
	If you have trouble hitting these targets, here is a hint. Pick a reasonable value for the vertical component of velocity (again, the minimum is 35 m/s). You can calculate how long the cannonball will be in the air, and then use that time to determine the required horizontal velocity. There are two ways you can determine this flight time; either by considering the relationship between the initial and final velocities of the cannonball, or by considering the vertical velocity at the peak of the cannonball’s motion, and what percentage of the flight time it spends reaching the peak. Applying either of these concepts, and motion equations that have been shown to you in this lab, you can calculate the flight time.

	</br></br>
	Using trigonometry, we can determine the velocity components from the firing speed (the magnitude of the velocity vector) and the angle at which the cannon is fired. 
	</br></br>
	In the picture below, note that the cannons again feature vector arrows that can be used to set the initial velocity. As you rotate the vector, a display reads out the angle above the horizontal. By lengthening or shortening the aiming vector, you can change the firing speed. 
	</br></br>

		<figcaption style="font-family: AvenirNextLTPro-Demi;">Exercise 7. Select a firing angle to hit the opposing targets.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	Your challenge in this exercise is to enter a speed and firing angle to hit the opposing targets before your opponent hits all of yours. 
	</br></br>
	This is similar to Exercise 6, except now your answers must be expressed in terms of firing speed and angle, rather than velocity components. You can convert between velocity components and speed and angle using the following equations: 
	</br></br>
	<i>v</i><sub>y</sub> = <i>v</i>&nbsp;sin<i>θ</i>
	</br>
	<i>v</i><sub>x</sub> = <i>v</i>&nbsp;cos<i>θ</i>
	</br></br>
	<i>v</i> = firing speed</br>
	<i>θ</i> = firing angle</br>
	<i>v</i><sub>x</sub> and <i>v</i><sub>x</sub> = velocity components 
	</br></br>
	The cannon in this simulation can rotate between 45 degrees and 90 degrees (for the cannon on the left), or 135 degrees to 90 degrees (for the cannon on the right). 
	</br></br>
	This time, each player has a battering ram. Every time a shot misses, the battering rams advance on the opposing castle. This means the battering rams are moving targets; they adjust their position after each miss. If you do not hit your opponent’s battering ram before it reaches your castle − look out!
	</br></br>
	<div class="pLabQASection">
		You rule the blue castle and control the cannon on the ground in front of it. Click on the head of the vector arrow and swivel it around until the value for the angle you want appears in the control panel. Shorten or lengthen the vector to change the firing speed. 
		</br></br>
		Either the computer or a classmate will run the cannon for the red castle. Whoever hits all the opposing targets first wins the game. 
		</br></br>
		Each side is trying to hit <b>two targets</b>: 1) an opening of the front door of the opposing castle, and 2) a battering ram team that advances on its mission of smashing your castle. 
		</br></br>
		Record your answers. Note the target, where it was located, and the firing angle used for your cannon to hit the targets. Record those values in the table below.

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Exercise 8 (optional): Establishing a range equation</div>
	Determining the correct firing speed and angle to hit a target requires a series of calculations. Is there a general approach (equation) for the case when the projectile begins and ends at the same height? 
	</br></br>
	It would help if you had an equation in which the cannon's range − how far the cannonball travels in the horizontal direction − is calculated from the initial firing speed and the cannon angle. If you knew the distance to the target, you could choose a firing angle and solve for the speed (or vice-versa), then blast away! 
	</br></br>
	But what is the equation? In this exercise, your challenge is to establish a range equation for your cannon. You can fire the cannonball at the small lake 225 meters away. 
	</br></br>

		<figcaption style="font-family: AvenirNextLTPro-Demi;">Exercise 8. Use the cannon to validate a range equation.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	Here are some hints on how to proceed:
	</br></br>
	<ul style='list-style-type:disc;padding-left: 18px;'>
		<li>
		Your goal is to write an equation so that the range, or horizontal distance, is dependent on initial speed and cannon angle. There can be other factors in the equation, but they must not vary with the shot (for instance, mass or a). The equation will be of a form so that range (Δx) is set equal to an expression in which the unknown variables are firing speed and aiming angle. 
		</li>
		</br>
		<li>
		Remember that range is calculated by knowing the horizontal component of the velocity and the time the cannonball stays in the air. 
		</li>
		</br>
		<li>
		You do not want time as a variable in this equation. You need to find a way to eliminate the time variable. (Extra hint: What determines the time the cannonball stays in the air? Consider writing a second equation and solving that equation for time. Remember that you do know the acceleration of the cannonball in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions.) 
		</li>
		</br>
		<li>
		Some of the standard motion equations might help!
		</li>
	</ul>
	</br>
	<div class="pLabQASection">
		You can use the cannon simulation to take data, and to experiment with the relationship between firing speed, cannon angle and range. 
		</br></br>
		As before, you can change the firing speed and angle by clicking on the vector arrow emanating from the cannon and swiveling it around until the desired speed and angle appear in the window. 
		</br></br>
		You also have a stopwatch, gauges and the usual buttons − FIRE, PAUSE and RESET.
		</br></br>
		If you succeed in writing an equation, make sure you use the simulation to test it. Enter some values in your equation and then see if the cannon in the simulation reproduces those results.  
		</br></br>
		If you cannot succeed in deriving this equation during the lab, you might ask your teacher or professor whether you can make it a homework assignment to turn in later. If so, fire the cannon a few times, and record the angle, speed and range. Use this data to confirm your equation.  
		</br></br>
		When you are done, return here to answer some follow-up questions.
