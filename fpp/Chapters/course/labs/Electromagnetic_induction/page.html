<div class="pLabPageIntro">
	A magnetic field can be used to induce, or create, an electromotive force (emf). This emf can drive an electric current. Electromagnetic induction is the basis for the generation of most of the electricity that is produced in the world today.
	</br></br>
	Electromagnetic induction can also be used to change or transform an emf (a voltage). It is used in devices called transformers that increase or decrease the voltage of an alternating current power supply.
	</br></br>
	In this lab, you will experiment with a way to induce an emf and to “generate” electricity. You will do so by spinning a wire loop in a magnetic field. 
	</br></br>
	You will then experiment with mutual induction, using the change in the magnetic field produced by one circuit to induce an emf in a second circuit. This is the phenomenon that underlies the functioning of transformers. It is used, for instance, to reduce the dangerously high potential differences in “high voltage lines” to a safer level of potential difference that can be used in the home.

	</br>
	A wire moving perpendicularly to a magnetic field “generates” an electric current. An industrial electric generator operates by the same principle, only it involves rotating a wire coil through a field. Here, the coil is just a single loop of wire.
	</br></br>
	The magnetic force acts on electrons in the wire. The amount of the force can be calculated using an equation: F = |q|vB sin θ.

		<figcaption style="font-family: AvenirNextLTPro-Demi;">Exercise 1. Observe how a spinning generator coil induces an emf.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	In this exercise we focus on the emf generated in the lengthwise wire segments that are parallel to the loop’s axis of rotation. We show the velocity of one of these segments as a black vector. The other parts of the loop make no net contribution to the emf. The rotating loop is connected by the two “leads” you see in the illustration to a complete circuit, which is not shown.
	</br></br>
	As the loop rotates through the magnetic field, the angle between the segment’s velocity and the field changes: The angle θ in the formula changes. At some points, the segment is moving perpendicularly to the field. At other points, it moves parallel to the field. The strength and orientation of the emf changes as the loop rotates. The current changes in strength and orientation along with the emf.
	</br></br>
	All this is simpler to see in the simulation, since it allows you to see the emf, and you can change the viewing angle, which proves highly useful.
	</br></br>
	In the simulation, you control a single parameter, the angular velocity ω of the loop. An output gauge displays the angle between the velocity of a segment of the wire and the magnetic field.
	</br></br>
	<div class="pLabQASection">
		Experiment with the generator in this simulation. When you open the simulation, the single loop is motionless in a magnetic field. You start it rotating by clicking the up button next to the angular velocity (ω) label and clicking on GO. Once you do this, a current will flow through the circuit and you can use the oscilloscope to view and measure the induced emf.

		There is a readout-only display of the angle θ. The red current arrows in the simulation represent the direction and relative magnitude of the conventional current.

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Exercise 2: Using mutual induction to transform voltage</div>
	</br>
	What if you want to induce a voltage (sometimes called emf, short for “electromotive force”) in a secondary circuit that has a different value from the voltage in a primary circuit? Can you think of a way to do this? You can do this by causing the amount of magnetic field passing through the circuit (called the magnetic flux) to differ between the two. 
	</br></br>
	How can you have a different magnetic flux through the two circuits when the same magnetic field is passing through both? One answer is: change the effective surface area of one circuit to make it different from the surface area of the other. Increasing the number of loops increases the effective surface area the magnetic field passes through, and this increases the magnetic flux. 
	</br></br>
	In the simulation for this section, we have fixed the value for the amplitude of the alternating emf in the primary set of coils, called a solenoid. The current in this circuit creates an “alternating” (oscillating) magnetic field that passes unchanged through the second solenoid. 
	</br></br>
	You can control the number of loops in the secondary circuit. Your task here is to observe what effect this has on induced emf. By varying the number of loops in the secondary circuit, you should be able to determine the general strategy for increasing (stepping up) a voltage or decreasing (stepping down) a voltage. 
	</br></br>
	<div class="pLabQASection">
		Open the simulation and you will see an experimental setup, with primary and secondary coils wrapped around a central iron core. In this simulation, you can set the number of coils in the secondary solenoid, from 10 loops to 50 in increments of 5, using the up-down buttons on the control panel. 
		</br></br>
		An alternating voltage (“emf”) is applied to the primary circuit. Observe the induced emf in the secondary circuit using the oscilloscope when the number of loops in both circuits is the same. 
		</br></br>
		Then change the number of loops in the secondary circuit. Do this systematically to determine the effect this has on the induced emf. Example: What happens to the induced emf if the number of secondary loops is half the number in the primary? What if it has twice as many loops?

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Exercise 3 (optional): Configuring a transformer</div>
	</br>
	A device that uses the principle of mutual induction to increase or decrease an alternating emf is called a <b>transformer</b>. You experimented earlier with a configuration consisting of primary and secondary loops, the fundamental components of a transformer.
	</br></br>
	The relationship between the potential difference across the primary coil and potential difference across the secondary coil can be calculated using the equation below. (When discussing transformers, it is traditional to refer to potential differences or voltages instead of emfs.) The area of the loops in each coil is assumed to be the same. The ratio of the potential differences is equal to the ratio of the number of loops in the two coils. 
	</br></br>
	In this simulation, you will see a gauge that displays the ball’s instantaneous velocity, its velocity at a moment in time. Instantaneous velocity is calculated in the same fashion as average velocity, but using the displacement that occurs during a very, very small interval of elapsed time.
	</br></br>
	<img src= "course/labs/Electromagnetic_induction/assets/image20.gif">
	</br></br>
	ΔVp = potential difference, primary coil
	ΔVs = potential difference, secondary coil	
	Np = number of loops in primary coil
	Ns = number of loops in secondary 
	</br></br>
	Your challenge in this exercise is to apply the transformer equation to correctly power a household circuit. Imagine you work for the power utility. Your job is to make sure that the household circuit has a peak emf of 170 volts,
	</br></br>
	In this exercise, a high voltage utility wire carrying alternating current runs by some houses, as shown in the diagram below. The peak emf in the incoming utility wire is 6800 volts.
	</br></br>

		<figcaption style="font-family: AvenirNextLTPro-Demi;">Exercise 3. Transform the emf from a high-voltage line.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	Your task is to configure the transformer on the pole between the high-voltage utility wire and the houses to deliver a peak emf of 170 V to the homes. 
	</br></br>
	<div class="pLabQASection">
		The generating plant outside of town is putting out an alternating emf with a peak value of 6800 volts across the utility wire coming into the pole transformer from the left. 
		</br></br>
		The transformer mounted on the pole is like the transformers that exist in cities and towns around the world. You can control the number of coils in both the primary and secondary coils.
		</br></br>
		Select a number of coils, from 10 to 1000, for the primary solenoid. Then select a number of coils, again from 10 to 1000, for the secondary solenoid. This is the solenoid in the circuit with the houses. 
		</br></br>
		Be careful: The wrong emf to the houses could have catastrophic effects!
		</br></br>
		When you think you have a transformer design that will work, press GO to apply the emf across the electrical circuits of the houses.

		A text box − as well as visual effects − will tell you if you have a correct answer. If you are wrong, press RESET and try again.
