	Race car drivers live in a world of <b>speed</b>, <b>velocity</b> and <b>acceleration</b>. What is the difference among the three? Let's review. Before you drive the perilous turns of a speedway, you first need to get your driver's license on a straightaway.

	</figure>
	Consider the track above, a snapshot of the simulation you are about to enter. You drive the red car.
	</br></br>
	Your challenge: beat the computer car − the blue car − in a drag race.
	</br></br>
	The track is divided into two segments. In the first segment, your car’s speed increases. Here, your car will go from rest (0 m/s) to the speed you select for it, up to a maximum of 30 m/s. In the second segment, the car will maintain the selected speed until the finish line, at which point the simulation will pause.
	</br></br>
	No calculations are required in this simulation. You will have to try setting some speeds and see what happens. The primary purpose of this exercise is to familiarize you with the simulation controls and to review the concepts of speed, velocity and acceleration.
	</br></br>
	When you enter the simulation, notice the gauges for your car (the red car) on the control panel:
	</br></br>

	<ul style='list-style-type:disc;padding-left: 18px;'>
		<li>On the left is a <b>speed</b> gauge. It resembles a standard car speedometer, although the readout is in meters per second. 10 m/s equals 36 km/hr, which is about 22 mph. </li>
		<li>The next gauge shows <b>acceleration</b>. It indicates the magnitude of your car's acceleration, in m/s<sup>2</sup>. </li>
		<li style="padding-top: 5px;">To the right of that is a horizontally-shaped gauge for <b>x velocity</b>. It shows the component of your car's velocity along the x axis, that is, in the horizontal direction on your screen. </li>

<div class="pExerciseContainer">
	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Exercise 2: Racing around a curve</div>
	</br>
	In Exercise 1, you controlled only the speed of your car. In physics and in car racing, direction matters, too. Most race tracks and roads have curves, and the driver must change the car’s direction to navigate around them. Velocity is a vector, and it reflects both speed and direction. 50 meters per second is speed, while 50 meters per second to the right is velocity.
	</br></br>
	Your car has two gauges that show the x and y components of the velocity. These gauges will help you understand the relationship between speed, velocity and acceleration when your car is traveling around a curve.
	</br></br>
	Consider the next race on the track shown below. This race begins the same as the first, with a straight Speed change zone. But the second segment, the Constant speed zone, has been bent into a curve. 
	</br>

		</br></br>
		<figcaption style="font-family: AvenirNextLTPro-Demi;">Exercise 2. Race against the computer around a curve.</figcaption>
		</br></br>
		Again, you drive the red car, and again, you set your speed. As before, this will be the speed at which you enter the Constant speed zone.
		</br></br>
		The track is divided into two segments. The Speed change zone is for speeding up: Here, your car will go from rest (0 m/s) to the speed you enter. In the Constant speed zone the car will maintain the speed you entered until the finish line, at which point the simulation will pause.
		</br></br>
		You do not know how fast your car will have to go to beat the blue car. As in Exercise 1, you must try various speeds until you win. This time, if your car’s speed is too high, it will spin off the track on the curve. Your primary goal in this exercise is to observe the gauges in your car and answer questions about speed, velocity and acceleration. Soon, you will use your knowledge of physics to move faster than the computer car without spinning off the track.

<div class="pExerciseContainer">
	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Exercise 3: Centripetal acceleration</div>
	</br>
	You have seen that a car moving at a constant speed accelerates when it changes direction. When a car travels along a circular path, the acceleration due to its change in direction is called <b>centripetal acceleration</b>.
	</br></br>
	You know how to determine the amount of <b>linear acceleration</b>. It is the change in instantaneous velocity divided by change in time as an object moves in a straight line. It results from a change in the speed, the magnitude of velocity.
	</br></br>
	Centripetal acceleration also is change in velocity divided by change in time but it results from the change in the direction of the velocity, not a change in magnitude.
	</br></br>
	<img src= "course/labs/Circular_motion/assets/image55.gif">
	</br></br>
	(Linear and centripetal acceleration can also occur simultaneously on a curve, for instance if the car speeds up or slows down along a curve, but that is a more advanced topic not covered in this lab.)
	</br></br>
	In the diagram shown here, you see the velocity vector <b>v<sub>i</sub></b> for a car in a turn at an initial time, and then the velocity vector <b>v<sub>f</sub></b> at a later time.
	</br></br>
	Note that the two vectors are the same length, indicating that the magnitude of velocity, or speed, is unchanged. The direction of the velocity vector clearly has changed.
	</br></br>
	Acceleration can be determined by the change in velocity per unit time. The change in velocity, <b>Δv</b>, is determined by subtracting the <b>vi</b> vector from the <b>v<sub>f</sub></b> vector.
	</br></br>
	In the lower diagram we graphically show the subtraction that yields the change in the velocity vector, <b>Δv</b>.
	</br></br>
	Note that the change in velocity (acceleration) points inward, toward the center of the circle. The centripetal acceleration vector always points to the center of the circle.
	</br></br>
	What determines the amount of centripetal acceleration?
	</br></br>
	In the next two exercises, you will investigate the two factors that determine the amount of centripetal acceleration. The first exercise explores the relationship between the tightness of a turn (its radius) and a car’s centripetal acceleration on that turn.
	</br></br>
	Later, you will use the equation for centripetal acceleration to calculate how to beat the computer car every time!
	</br></br>
	Consider the next track, in which the cars navigate a course with two turns. The two turns are sections of circles with different radii, as you can see: 
	</br>

		<figcaption style="font-family: AvenirNextLTPro-Demi;">Exercise 3. Find the relationship between turn radius and centripetal acceleration.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	In this race, you pick a speed for the red car, and it will travel at that same speed for the entire race.
	</br></br>
	The computer car also maintains a constant speed for the entire race.
	</br></br>
	The game challenge is to beat the computer car to the finish. If your centripetal acceleration is too great on either curve, you will spin off the track and lose. You are accelerating too much for the frictional force between the tires and the road to keep you on the track. You have to use trial and error to beat the race car.
	</br></br>
	The physics question posed by this simulation is: What is the relationship between the radius of a turn and the car’s centripetal acceleration?

	</br>
	In the previous two exercises, you explored the relationship between centripetal acceleration and two variables: the radius of a circular curve, r, and the speed with which an object negotiates the curve, v.
	</br></br>
	Your data showed that centripetal acceleration varies <b>inversely</b> with the curve radius.
	</br></br>
	Centripetal acceleration is also proportional to the square of the speed.
	</br></br>
	The equation for centripetal acceleration is provided in the box to the right.

	<img src= "course/labs/Circular_motion/assets/image56.gif">
	</br></br>
	You already intuitively understand these relationships − on skis, in a car, or on a bicycle, you know to slow down when entering a tight curve. You may not have known it at the time, but you were reducing your centripetal acceleration.
	</br></br>
	It is time to put your physics knowledge to the test in a high-speed car race!
	</br></br>
	In the course pictured below, you will use your knowledge of centripetal acceleration to go as fast as possible in the turns without crashing.

	The radius of each turn is listed on the track. In this race, the maximum centripetal acceleration you can attain before crashing is 3 g's, or 29.4 m/s<sup>2</sup>. This roughly corresponds to the maximum centripetal acceleration experienced by drivers in the Daytona 500 as they speed around the track’s steeply-banked turns.
	</br></br>
	If you exceed 29.4 m/s<sup>2</sup> centripetal acceleration in any turn, your car will spin off the track. The cars have staggered starts to compensate for the different distances they travel due to the curves.
	</br></br>
	Your challenge: Select a speed in the control panel so your acceleration is slightly below 29.4 m/s<sup>2</sup>.
	</br></br>
	We have programmed the cars so they will speed up and slow down in the straight-aways to attain the turn speeds at the beginning of each turn. Once in a turn, the cars will travel at the speed you set.
	</br></br>
	The computer car is calibrated to run the race at more than 95 percent of the maximum safe speed for each turn. Only a well-programmed car will beat the computer.

	Here you can have some fun and test your basic driving skills. So far, you have been experimenting with uniform circular motion, motion in two dimensions in which the speed and radius are constant. This is a special case of motion that occurs along two or three dimensions.
	</br></br>
	Here, we relax the constraints. You attempt to drive your car along a circular path, but it is unlikely you will achieve perfectly uniform circular motion. You control the horizontal and vertical velocity using the arrow keys on your keyboard. The right arrow increases the horizontal velocity component and the left arrow decreases it. The up arrow key increases the vertical velocity, and yes, the down arrow decreases it. Your mission is to stay on the course and if possible, complete a lap, using these keys.

	</br>
	Now you have to use what you know about the force of friction and apply Newton’s second law to win the race. Each turn has a section where the heat of the day has caused the pavement to start to melt, as you can see in the illustration below. The coefficient of friction for your tires on these slick sections is 0.75. Your car has better traction everywhere else. The mass of your car is 1724 kg.
	</br></br>
	The friction supplies the centripetal force, the force that keeps the car moving around a turn instead of flying off the track along a straight line. By multiplying your car’s centripetal acceleration by its mass, you can determine the centripetal force required to keep the car on the track. (You are applying Newton’s second law, multiplying mass by acceleration to determine force.)
	</br></br>
	Since you want to go as fast as possible, determine the maximum frictional force, and from that, determine the maximum speed at which your car can move. Set the speed of your car to that value, or slightly below if necessary, to win the race. You will move at the same speed in this simulation through both turns. You only need to determine the maximum speed for one of the turns, if you pick the right turn.
