	</br>
	Wear disposable gloves when handling the sources.

	<span style="font-weight:bold;">General Lab Safety:</span>
	</br></br>
	Observe all procedures detailed by your instructor.
	</br></br>
	Keep a clean and orderly work space.
	</br></br>
	If you break or spill something, notify your instructor immediately.
	</br></br>
	If someone needs first aid, notify your instructor immediately.
	</br></br>
	When you have completed an experiment, always dispose of, recycle or store equipment and supplies in their proper location.
	</br></br>
	If in doubt: Ask!

		<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;padding-left: 31px;line-height: 32px;">		
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Turn on the instrument with the voltage set as low as possible, and allow it to warm up for the amount of time specified by the manufacturer.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Place a prepared source, (204Tl or another beta emitter) into the tube stand below the GM tube.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Reset the instrument so that the counts are at zero.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Observe and record the number of counts per minute at the lowest voltage.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Plot the counts per minute vs. voltage as you proceed, so that you can see the shape of the graph as it develops.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Increase the voltage by 25 or 50 volts, and try again.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">In order to prevent continuous discharge, do not let the count rate rise more than 10% above the plateau value.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Determine the best operating voltage for the tube. The “best” voltage to operate at is chosen within the plateau, generally in the lower 1/4 of it, which helps preserve tube life.</li>

			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">No sources will be used in this experiment; make sure they are kept far away from the radiation counter.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Observe and record the counts for three 5-minute long data runs with no shielding around the GM tube.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Now place some lead bricks around the tube so that it is shielded completely from background radiation.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Observe and record the counts for three 5-minute long data runs with lead shielding around the GM tube.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Convert the observed activities to counts per minute and find the average of your 3 trials in each case. How much is the background radiation reduced by the shielding?</li>

			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Place the radioactive sample (i.e., 204Tl or 32P) on shelf #1, the highest shelf, which is closest to the detector.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Determine the number of counts per minute (cpm). Make sure to correct the raw data by subtracting the background count.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Move the sample down to shelf #2 and repeat step #19.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Move the sample down another shelf and repeat until you have data for each of the shelves.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Assign to shelf #1 a shelf ratio of 1.00. Calculate the shelf ratios for the other shelves by dividing the cpm for shelf #1 into the cpm for each of the other shelves.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">If you have time, measure the shelf ratios for another radioactive source (e.g., 14C). Did it depend upon the identity of the sample used?</li>
