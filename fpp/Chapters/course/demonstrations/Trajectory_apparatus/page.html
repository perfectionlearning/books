	This experiment involves moving objects. Be sure that nothing is in the way when the projectile is launched.

	Stroboscopes can be dangerous to look at and can cause injury to people with certain medical conditions.

</br>
		On the computer, open the photo with Paint&reg;, and rotate the photograph using the software until the plumb line is vertical.
		</br></br>
		Find the scale factor of your photo. To do so, place the computer cursor on two points on the meterstick that are visible in the photograph. You can read off the “pixel coordinates” from the computer program. Since you know the “real-life” separation of the two selected points, you now have a scale factor that will allow you to translate pixel coordinates to real-life x-y coordinates.
		</br></br>
		For example, if 0.30 m on the meter stick corresponds to 3000 pixels on the photograph, then your scale factor is 0.30m/3000 pixels = 1E-4 meters/pixel.
		</br></br>
		Enlarge the photo enough so that you can see the white dots corresponding to the images of the ball. Place the cursor over each dot and read the coordinates displayed in the lower right corner of the Paint&reg; window. Record these coordinates as “X(pixels)” and “Y(pixels).” Convert them to real-life coordinates by multiplying by the scale factor you determined earlier.
		</br></br>
		Let t = 0 correspond to the location of the first image of the ball. Make a graph of x versus t and do a straight line fit.
		</br></br>
		Now consider the y-values. Calculate the average velocity in the y direction for each interval of 1/15 sec; for example, for the interval between position 3 and position 5, the average velocity in the y direction is

		<span><img style="vertical-align:middle" src="course/demonstrations/Trajectory_apparatus/assets/image002.gif"/>.Do this for each point in your data table.</span>
		</br></br>
		If the acceleration is constant, the average velocity that you calculate in this way is equal to the instantaneous velocity at t<sub>4</sub>. Calculate the instantaneous y-velocity for each of the times in your experiment (except for the first and the last).
		</br></br>
		Make a plot of v<sub>y</sub> vs. t and do a straight line fit.
