<div class="pLabPageIntro">
	Ballistic carts shoot an object straight up. Vertical motion is one part of the study of projectile motion.
	</br></br>
	This demonstration will also cover the case of an initial velocity at an angle, in case your cart can do that.
	</br></br>
	Other available school equipment, such as a pitching machine, can also be used.

	Make sure that no one will be struck by the projectile that the cart launches.
	</br></br>
	Do not place your hands in the equipment unless it is turned off and/or the batteries are removed.
	</br></br>
	Turn off the equipment before you load the projectile.

	</br>
	Letting the cart move horizontally at constant velocity, ask students where they expect the ball to land relative to the cart. Give the cart different initial horizontal velocities.
	</br></br>
	One method to measure the constant horizontal velocity of the ball and the cart is for you to lay a meterstick parallel to the cart’s path and use a stopwatch to determine how long it takes the cart to cover a certain distance. Use a scientific calculator to divide the distance by the elapsed time.
	</br></br>
	Another method to measure the cart’s constant horizontal velocity is to attach a horizontal flag to the side of the cart. When the flag passes through a photogate, the light will be blocked for a certain time interval, as recorded by your computer. Divide the flag length by the time interval to find the cart’s horizontal velocity.

	</br>
	If the ball does not land exactly on the cart, ask students about the real-world factors that might cause it not to land there.
	</br>

<div class="pExerciseContainer">
	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Demonstration 3</div>
	</br>
	If you have digital video analysis equipment, determine and compare the initial horizontal velocities of the ball and the cart. If they differ at all, explain why they might.

	</br>
	Attach a string to the front of the ballistic cart so that the string can pass over a pulley with table clamp, to a mass hanger with slotted masses. The tension in the string will cause the ballistic cart to accelerate.
	</br>
	</br>
	One method to measure the cart’s acceleration is to attach a paper tape to the rear of the ballistic cart, and use carbon paper and a ticker timer to make marks on the paper tape. From the marks, you will be able to determine the linear acceleration of the ballistic cart.
	</br>
	</br>
	An alternate method to measure the cart’s acceleration is to use a data acquisition probe, such as an ultrasonic motion sensor, to measure the position, velocity and/or acceleration of the cart over time.
	</br>
	</br>
	Now ask the students where they expect the ball to land relative to the cart. Perform several trials.

	</br>
	Let the ballistic cart roll down an inclined plane, and let the trigger launch the ball while the cart is accelerating down the plane. Remind the students that the ball is launched straight up relative to the cart. Now, ask them where they expect the ball to land relative to the cart. Do several trials, varying the angle of the plane, and use a protractor to measure the angle of inclination of the plane from the horizontal.
