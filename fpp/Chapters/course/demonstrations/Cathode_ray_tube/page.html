	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Safety</div>
	Safety is a primary concern with this equipment. Even low voltages can be dangerous. The appropriate grounding of metal parts should be done, as well as the correct insulation of all electrical components. Anyone near the equipment should be on an insulated surface.
	</br></br>
	The CRT is a specialized piece of equipment. Please watch the Perfection video on its use and consult the instructions for your specific piece of equipment.
	</br></br>
	You will also be using a power supply. Again, consult the Perfection video and the vendor’s safety manual for safety instructions.

	Tell students that electrons flow from cathode to anode through the tube, and ask, “What will be the effect of placing a horseshoe magnet around the CRT?”

	<div class="pLabQASection">
		1.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ask the students to make a prediction of which way the beam will bend.
		</br></br>
		2.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Apply the filament voltage until the filament glows.
		</br></br>
		3.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Next, apply an accelerating voltage until the beam is emitted. In many CRTs built for physics demonstrations, a phosphor screen (that spans the length of the tube) glows when struck by electrons, making the beam visible. 
		</br></br>
		4.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Check the accelerating voltage with a multimeter.
		</br></br>
		5.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Place the horseshoe magnet near the tube so that the north pole is on one side and the south pole is on the other. (If in doubt as to which is which, check the polarity using a magnetic compass. The end of the needle that points roughly toward the geographic north pole is a magnetic north pole, and opposite poles attract.) 
		</br></br>
		6.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ask the students to describe and sketch the results.
