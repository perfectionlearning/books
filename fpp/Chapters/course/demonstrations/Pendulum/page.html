	</br>A mass on the end of a string is an example of a simple pendulum. If the mass is displaced from the vertical equilibrium position and then released, it will execute simple harmonic motion (approximately) with a period T of

	</br></br>
	where L is the length of the pendulum, and g is the acceleration due to gravity.
	</br></br>
	A detailed analysis will show that the period actually increases very slightly as the amplitude increases. Fortunately, if the amplitude is kept to a few degrees, the formula above is accurate to better than 0.1%. You don't have to measure the amplitude accurately: just keep the amplitude fairly small.

	</br>
	Re-arrange the equation above to show that the square of the period is proportional to the length of the pendulum. What is the constant of proportionality?

	</br>
	Does the period depend on the mass?

	</br>
	For a single value of L, and a single swing, have several students measure T with a stopwatch, for one back and forth swing of the pendulum. Is there a relatively large “spread” in the results? To quantify the “spread”, calculate the standard deviation of the different measurements.
	</br></br>
	Identify the causes of the uncertainty in the measured data. What are some reasons that the students got different results? Didn’t they all measure the same thing?
	</br></br>
	Identify the effects of the uncertainty in the measured data. If you use the lowest value of T in the equation that relates T, L, and g, what value of g do you obtain? What happens if you use the highest value of T that was measured?
	</br></br>
	Quantify the causes of the uncertainty in the measured data. How confident are you in the result of the experiment of measuring the time for one back and forth swing? Are you sure that your result is accurate to within, say, 1 second? How about 0.5 seconds? (Hint: you may want to do some experiments regarding human reaction time.)
	</br></br>
	For the same value of L, now have different students measure T with a stopwatch, for 10 back and forth swings of the pendulum (and then dividing the total time by 10). Is there a smaller “spread” in the results? To quantify the “spread”, calculate the standard deviation of the different measurements.
	</br></br>
	Now that you each have measured T using 10 complete swings, if you use the lowest value of T in the equation that relates T, L, and g, what value of g do you obtain? What happens if you use the highest value of T that your group measured? Comment on the advantages and disadvantages of making measurements of 10 periods vs. making just one.
	</br></br>
	Can you design a new experiment to measure T that can eliminate or reduce some of the uncertainties that you have encountered?
