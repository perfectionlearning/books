	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Safety</div>
	</br>Be sure your hands and clothing are dry before handling any electrical components.
	</br></br>
	Check electrical equipment to ensure that there are no frayed wires. If you find a frayed wire or other damage to an electrical cord, notify your instructor immediately. DO NOT use the equipment.
	</br></br>
	Do not touch both terminals of a battery at the same time.
	</br></br>
	Handle wire by keeping your hands on the insulated portion of the wire.
	</br></br>
	Use insulated tools to connect wires and electrical components in a circuit.
	</br></br>
	Remember, even low voltage can cause injury.

	<div style= "font-weight: bold;color: #2184a1;">Question(s) for Students</div></br>
	Here, you will consider the relationship of current, potential difference, and power for components or different resistances connected in series. The following questions should guide your experimental design.
	</br></br>
	Does the same amount of current flow through components connected in series? Or is it a function of the resistance of the component?
	</br></br>
	Is the potential difference measured across each of the components going to be the same when they are connected in series? Or is it a function of the resistance of the component?
	</br></br>
	Is the power consumption the same for each of the components connected in series? Or is it a function of the resistance of the component?
	</br></br>
	How does the total power consumed by all the components compare to the total power supplied by the battery?
	</br></br>
	How is the resistance of each of the components related to the overall, equivalent resistance of the series combination? Explain.

	<div style= "font-weight: bold;color: #2184a1;">Steps in Demonstration 1:</div></br>
	<div class="pLabQASection">
		<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;padding-left: 31px;line-height: 32px;">
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Arrange two identical mini-lightbulbs so that they are in a series combination. The circuit should be powered by a battery or by a DC power supply. Build a knife switch into your circuit so that current will flow only when the switch is closed. This will help keep the battery from being drained when you are not actively taking measurements.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Measure and compare the current in each of the bulbs to the total current entering the combination.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Measure and compare the voltage across each of the bulbs to the total voltage across the combination.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">From the previous measurements, verify the resistance of each bulb. (Note: the resistance of the bulb may change when the filament is cold compared to when it is hot, which may result in some error.)</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Use the multimeter to measure the total resistance of the combination.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Calculate the electric power consumed by each bulb. Power equals the product of current and voltage.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Calculate the total power consumed by the combination.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">If desired, repeat the previous steps using resistors instead of lightbulbs.</li>
		</ol>

	<div style= "font-weight: bold;color: #2184a1;">Question(s) for Students</div></br>Here, you will consider the relationship of current, potential difference, and power for components or different resistances connected in parallel. The following questions should guide your experimental design.
	</br></br>
	Does the same amount of current flow through components connected in parallel? Or is it a function of the resistance of the component?
	</br></br>
	Is the potential difference measured across each of the components going to be the same when they are connected in parallel? Or is it a function of the resistance of the component?
	</br></br>
	Is the power consumption the same for each of the components connected in parallel? Or is it a function of the resistance of the component?
