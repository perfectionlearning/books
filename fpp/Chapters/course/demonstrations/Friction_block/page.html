	</br>
	You can use a friction block on an inclined plane to calculate the coefficient of static friction between two materials. As the plane is inclined more and more from the horizontal, at some point the block just begins to slide. At that moment, what is the relationship between the static friction coefficient and the angle of inclination of the plane from the horizontal?

		 <li style= "padding-left: 15px">Measure the angle of inclination, using a protractor or by using trigonometry.</li>
		 <li style= "padding-left: 15px">Incline the plane until the force of gravity just overcomes friction and causes the friction block to slide.</li>
		 <li style= "padding-left: 15px">Now, repeat the experiment and incline it just a hair less. The plane is now at the angle at which the maximum force of static friction just balances the component of the blockâ€™s weight that is directed down the plane. </li>
		 <li style= "padding-left: 15px">At this point, the static friction is at its maximum. The tangent of the angle of inclination of the plane is the coefficient of static friction. </li>
