	A discharge tube is a gas-filled tube which contains electrodes, typically in a glass tube. The gas in the tube is of one type, and typical examples include hydrogen, helium, neon and argon.

	Even low voltages can be dangerous. Make sure that the power supply is in good working order, with appropriate grounding of metal parts, and insulation of all electrical component where appropriates.
	</br></br>
	The discharge tube is a specialized piece of equipment. Please watch the Perfection video on its use and consult the instructions for your specific piece of equipment.
	</br></br>
	You will also be using a power supply. Again, consult the Perfection video and the vendorâ€™s safety manual for safety instructions.

	Show discrete emission lines from a gas discharge tube. Ask them to use their textbooks, a periodic table with data on electron configuration and energy levels, and an electromagnetic spectrum chart to predict some of the wavelengths that they will observe.

		1.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Turn on the power supply. The gas begins to glow.

		2.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ask students to aim their handheld visual spectroscopes at the light.
		</br></br>
		3.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ask them to sketch and describe the results.
		</br></br>
		4.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ask them to record the wavelengths of the lines that they see, and to create a table with the results.
