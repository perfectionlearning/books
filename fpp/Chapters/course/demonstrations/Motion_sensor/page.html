	If a small wind-up toy moves at constant velocity, what will its position vs. time graph look like? What about its velocity vs. time graph? What about its acceleration vs. time graph?

			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Connect your interface box to your computer, plug in the power supply, and turn on the interface.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Mount your ultrasonic motion sensor on a ring stand, using clamps and 90-degree rod clamps.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Connect the sensor to the interface box.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Orient the motion sensor so it points along the table at the wind-up toy. Make sure you can watch the computer display as the toy moves.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Start the computer program and ask it to display graphs of position, velocity, and acceleration against time.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Wind up the toy and set it on the table.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Start taking data. You may hear a clicking noise from the ultrasonic sensor.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Choose your best run for further analysis. To curve fit the data, click the "Fit" icon located just above the graph, with a "Linear Fit" option. The program will display information about the line of best fit through your data.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Record the equation of the line of best fit for your position data using the slope and intercept shown by the "Linear Fit" function. The standard equation for a linear fit is y = m×x + b, where m is the slope and b is the y intercept. In this case, the slope of the position data, which is the derivative of the linear function, represents the velocity.</li>

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Experiment 2: A toy moving with constant acceleration</div>
	</br>
	<div style= "font-weight: bold;color: #2184a1;">Question(s) for Students</div>
	</br>
	If a small toy car moves with constant acceleration, what will its position vs. time graph look like? What about its velocity vs. time graph? What about its acceleration vs. time graph?
	</br></br>
	If the plane is inclined at an angle of θ off the horizontal, what is the expected acceleration of the toy car down the plane? Assume that it moves just like a frictionless object sliding down the inclined plane.

			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Set up an inclined plane by putting a small object under one end of a flat board or something similar.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Measure the angle of inclination from the horizontal using a protractor, or by making linear measurements and using trigonometry.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Set up the data acquisition sensor as before, only now, clamp the motion sensor with the ring stand, clamps, and 90-degree clamps so that it points down the inclined plane, parallel to its surface.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Start the computer program and ask it to display graphs of position, velocity, and acceleration against time.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Set the toy car at the top of the inclined plane, about 10 cm in front of the motion sensor.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Let go of the car and start taking data. You may hear a clicking noise from the ultrasonic sensor.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Choose your best run for further analysis. To curve fit the data, click the "Fit" icon located just above the graph, with a "Linear Fit" option if the data points fall on a straight line, or a “Quadratic Fit” or “second-degree fit” if the data points fall on a parabola (a special kind of curve). The program will display information about the best fit through your data.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">By looking at the parameters of your best fit lines and parabolas, you will be able to determine the acceleration of the car. How do the numbers compare to what you expect from theory?</li>
