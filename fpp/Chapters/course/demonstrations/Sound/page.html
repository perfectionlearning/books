<div class="pLabPageIntro">
	Acoustic (sound) resonance can be used to determine the wavelength of a sound wave. Tuning forks are labeled with the frequency they generate. Using resonance and a tuning fork, you can determine both the frequency and wavelength of a sound wave.
	</br></br>
	Since wave speed is the product of frequency and wavelength, you can determine the speed of sound in air.
	</br></br>
	Resonance tubes can be as simple as a plastic tube being dipped into water in a graduated cylinder, or as complicated as a dedicated expanding cardboard tube from a physics equipment supplier. We will describe the experimental procedure using the former method, but if you have a resonance tube, the procedure is very similar.
	</br></br>
	Sound is a wave. As your textbook discusses, reflecting waves interfere. If they interfere constructively, they get louder. An acoustic wave will constructively interfere with a closed air column at specific fractions of its wavelength, namely at 1/4, 3/4, and 5/4, etc. of its wavelength. When the air column’s length equals these fractions of the sound’s wavelength, the sound produced by a tuning fork held above such an air column will become louder.

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Safety</div>
	The vibrations of tuning forks can damage or shatter plastic and glass tubes. Do not touch the tube or the graduated cylinder with the vibrating turning fork! 
	</br></br>
	<b>General Lab Safety:</b>
	</br></br>
	Observe all procedures detailed by your instructor.
	</br></br>
	Keep a clean and orderly work space.
	</br></br>
	If you break or spill something, notify your instructor immediately.
	</br></br>
	If someone needs first aid, notify your instructor immediately.
	</br></br>
	When you have completed an experiment, always dispose of, recycle, or store equipment and supplies in their proper location.
	</br></br>
	If in doubt: Ask!

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Demonstration 1: Estimate the Wavelength</div>
	</br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; "><b>Ask the Students</b></div></br>
	About what height should a closed air column be (i.e., the length of the PVC tube above the water) for resonance at the first harmonic?
	</br></br>
	Using round numbers and assuming a tuning fork with a frequency of 300 Hz and a speed of sound about 340 meters per second, the wavelength is about 1.1 meters. Dividing by 4 for the first harmonic means an estimate of 25 to 30 centimeters. 
	</br>

<div class="pExerciseContainer">
	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Demonstration 2: Harmonics</div>
	</br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; "><b>Ask the Students</b></div></br>
	What will be the ratio of the lengths of the air columns for the first three acoustic resonances? They occur at 1/4, 3/4, and 5/4 the wavelength.
	</br></br>
	The second acoustic resonance will be at three times the length of the first and the third will be at five times the first. Multiply the original estimate of the first harmonic by 3 and 5 to calculate the approximate second set of lengths.

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Demonstration 3: Calculate the Speed of Sound</div>
	</br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; "><b>Ask the Students</b></div></br>
	How might we calculate the speed of sound given our ability to calculate the wavelength and the known frequency of the tuning fork?
	</br></br>
	(Answer: Multiply the two together (making sure we use meters for length), and we have the speed of sound.)

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Demonstration 4: Wavelength and Frequency</div>
	</br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; "><b>Ask the Students</b></div></br>
	If we use different frequency tuning forks, what relationship should we expect to see between wavelength and frequency?
	</br></br>
	The two multiplied together equal the speed of sound. Wavelength and frequency have an inverse relationship.
