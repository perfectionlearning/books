	Ripple tanks contain complex equipment, and the overall system combines water and electricity. Be careful and follow instructions carefully to avoid hazards.

	</br>
	How is the angle at which the waves spread out related to the width of the single slit (i.e., the distance between the barriers)?
	</br></br>
	How is the angle at which the waves spread out related to the wavelength (i.e., the distance between the wave fronts)?

	How is the angle at which the waves spread out related to the frequency?

	How is the angle at which the waves spread out related to the distance between the slits?
