	A virtual image is on the opposite side of the mirror than the object it is created from. It cannot be projected onto a piece of paper at its perceived location. A real image is on the same side as the object that creates it and can be projected onto a piece of paper.

	A plane mirror is a flat mirror.

	</br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Discussion:</div></br>
	You want to determine how tall a mirror must be so that one can see both the top of one’s head (including a hat) and one’s toes. 
	</br></br>
	<div class="pLabQASection">
		4.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Have a student stand in front of a full-length plane mirror.
		</br></br>
		5.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Start with the toes. Have a second student raise the ruler until it reaches the height on the mirror at which the first student sees her toes. In other words, the second student raises the ruler from the bottom of the mirror until it reaches the height at which it will block the first student’s view of her own toes. Mark this point with masking tape.
		</br></br>
		6.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Repeat this, starting at the top, finding the location at which the ruler will block the first student’s view of the top of her own head (or hat). Mark this location with masking tape.
		</br></br>
		7.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Measure the distance between the masking tape positions.
		</br></br>
		8.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Remove the tape.
		</br></br>
		9.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp How does the distance you measured compare to the total height of the first student?
		</br></br>
		10.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ask students to explain this with a ray tracing diagram. Hint: The angle of reflection must equal the angle of incidence. Draw a ray from the eyes to the mirror to the toes. Consider congruent triangles. Then repeat this process for a ray from the eyes to the mirror,up to the top of the head.
