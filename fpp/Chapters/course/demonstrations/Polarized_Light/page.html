	</br>
	Do not look directly into the laser beam or cause the beam to be directed or reflected into anyone’s eyes!
	</br></br>
	The only safe way to view the beam or any of its reflections is to have it strike a diffuse reflector, such as a card.
	</br></br>
	Keep the beam parallel to the table top, and be aware of the direct and reflected beams.
	</br></br>
	Remove watches and reflective jewelry.

	</br>
	If you place a linear polarizer in front of unpolarized light, it is half as intense on the other side. What do you think will happen to the brightness if the linear polarizer is rotated? Will the intensity change?

			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">If you have a photometer, measure the intensity of the polarized laser light on the screen. It should be half of what it was before. (Some lasers emit light that is partially polarized, so you may obtain better results with an incandescent lamp.)</li>

	</br>
	If initially unpolarized light passes through one polarizer, and then a second one whose transmission axis is parallel to that of the first one, what will be the final intensity of the light?

	If initially unpolarized light passes through one polarizer, and then a second one whose transmission axis is perpendicular to that of the first one, what will be the final intensity of the light?

			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Place the laser in a holder and place it at the left end of the optics bench, aimed toward the viewing screen at the other end. Place a linear polarizer in front of the laser.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Turn on the laser and note the approximate brightness of the spot on the screen. If you have a photometer, measure the intensity of the laser light on the screen.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Place a second polarizer on the optics bench after the first polarizer.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">The one closest to the light source is the Polarizer. The second will be called the Analyzer.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Initially, let the transmission axis of the Analyzer be parallel to that of the Polarizer. That is, the angle θ = 0. The intensity of the light should be the same as when there is only one polarizer in place.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Observe the laser spot on the screen as you rotate the Analyzer. Record your observations in your laboratory notebook.</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Ask “What happens when the transmission axes are at right angles to each other?” (The light is extinguished.) “Why does this occur?” (A pair of crossed polarizers lets through no light.)</li>
			<li style = "padding-left:15px;">If you have a photometer, measure the intensity of the polarized laser light on the screen as you rotate the Analyzer. Make a graph of intensity vs. angle θ. Is it what you expect from theory?</li>
