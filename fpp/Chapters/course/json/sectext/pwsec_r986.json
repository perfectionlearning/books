There is a spiral track on the CD where information is stored. The laser reads information off of the track. In the animation, we zoom in on a section of the track. ","The diagram shows a close-up of a cross section of a CD track. The bottom surface is coated with a reflective material. You see the raised surfaces called pits.  The areas between them are called lands. ","The laser light reflects off the surface and is read by the sensor. We draw the laser light as two rays and exaggerate the distance between those rays so you can see them. Here the path lengths are essentially equal, so the interference between the two components of the laser beam is constructive. ","We show the CD rotating a little in the second animation.  Part of the beam reflects off the pit and part off the land. The path lengths are no longer the same, and the interference becomes destructive. This means the light reaching the sensor will be less bright. ","As the disk rotates, the reflected light is more or less bright depending on whether the interference is constructive or destructive. The sensor notes the intensity of the signal and conveys this information to the rest of the system. "],"objNames":["wb_CD_DVD_concepts1","wb_CD_DVD_concepts2"]}
