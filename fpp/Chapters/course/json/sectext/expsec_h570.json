","In the 17th century, Newton thought about what would happen if a very powerful cannon fired a projectile, like a stone, from a high mountain. Newton stated that, since Earth is curved, the faster the projectile, the farther it would travel around Earth.","Fired fast enough, at about 8,000 meters per second, the projectile would just keep going, never touching the ground. Due to the curvature of Earth, the projectile never falls far enough to touch the ground.","Why does a fast-moving projectile never hit the surface of Earth? Earth’s surface “falls away” as fast as the projectile descends. In the second diagram, we show the horizontal and vertical motion of the projectile in one second.","A stone fired with horizontal velocity will fall five meters in about one second. It will not hit the ground because in the time it takes the stone to move 8,000 meters horizontally, Earth’s surface curves enough that the stone’s vertical descent keeps it the same distance from Earth."],"objNames":["wb_newton_cannon_concept1","wb_newton_cannon_concept2"]}
