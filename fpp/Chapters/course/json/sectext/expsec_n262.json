","Because sound waves spread as they travel, the intensity of sound diminishes as you move farther away from a sound source. For example, the sound is less intense at point B in the diagram than at point A, because it has spread over a greater area.  ","The intensity decreases by the square of the distance.  As the table shows, the intensity is one-fourth as intense at 2 meters as 1 meter, and one-sixteenth as intense at four meters as 1 meter. ","Sound intensity equals power divided by the surface area. The unit is the <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_power_equation10'>watt<\/a>, the unit for power, per square meter.  ","We show the equation for sound intensity for a spherical wave front. The expression in the denominator of the second equation is the formula for the surface area of a sphere.  It shows why the intensity decreases by the square of the distance: The surface area of a sphere is proportional to the square of its radius."],"objNames":["wb_sound_intensity_concepts","wb_sound_intensity_equation"]}
