    "Heat can transfer in or out of an engine.  If the majority of the heat is flowing in, the sign of the heat is positive − the engine is gaining energy and the net heat flow is positive.  ",
    "The net heat flow equals the difference of the heat in and the heat out. If it is negative, then the net flow of heat is out − the engine is losing energy as the net heat flow is negative. ",
    "A system like an engine can do <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_work_concept2'>work</a>, such as when a piston pushes up.  That is positive work, and <b>it</b><b>means a positive quantity is subtracted in the first law</b>, since it reduces the engine’s energy.  When work is done on a system, such as an external force pressing on a system, the work is negative. Since work is subtracted in the first law, <b>the negative work increases the engine’s energy</b>.
