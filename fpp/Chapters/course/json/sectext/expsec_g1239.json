We calculate the mean of these five data values: 6, \u22123, \u22123, 6 and 4.","The sum here is 10. The count is 5 since there are 5 pieces of data: 6, \u22123, \u22123, 6, and 4. Dividing the sum by the count, we get a mean of 2.","The median and the mode can also be used to characterize a set of numbers. The median is the middle value when the values are arranged from smallest to largest.","We use the same data as above, but arrange it in order, and choose the middle value, 4, as the median. We have an odd number of values, so there is one middle number.  If we had an even number of values, we would average the middle two. ","The mode is the value, or values, that show up most often. The numbers \u22123 and 6 both occur twice in our data, so they are modes."],"objNames":["wb_mean","wb_median_mode"]}
