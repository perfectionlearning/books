    "As with velocity, there is instantaneous acceleration and average acceleration.  The definitions of velocity and acceleration are parallel in this regard.  Instantaneous acceleration is the acceleration at a moment of time, and average takes the change of velocity over a period of time, and divides it by that period of time.  ",
    "In this text, when we use acceleration, we typically mean average or a constant acceleration.  For instance, in the motion equations we present later, a constant or average acceleration is assumed.    ",
    "The equation we show defines average acceleration: It is the change in velocity divided by elapsed time.  The change in velocity is the final velocity minus the initial velocity."
