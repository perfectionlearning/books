The coefficient of determination has values between 0 and 1. Its value can measure how well the model fits the data.","The coefficient of determination is usually indicated as <i>r</i><sup class=\"\">2</sup>. The closer <i>r</i><sup class=\"\">2</sup> is to 1, the better the model equation describes the data. ","We show a graph of intensity and frequency. The graph shows an extremely high correlation of 0.9944 for our model.  Visually, this corresponds to the measured data points being close to the line. ","The second graph, velocity versus mass, is an example where a linear model is not a good model.  The <i>r</i><sup class=\"\">2</sup> is about 0.001.  By visually inspecting the graph, you see that the points are far from the line.  It is possible that another equation type (such as exponential) might work better − or perhaps there simply is no correlation between the two variables being plotted.
