{"cards":[{"lines":[{"type":"title","text":"Play with momentum"}]}],"definitions":[],"secText":["The activity in this section starts your exploration of momentum. The linear momentum of an object equals the product of its mass and velocity. Momentum is a useful concept when applied to collisions, a subject that can be a lot of fun. ","At the left is an activity that you can use to begin your study of momentum. You set the starting velocity for both the blue and the red pucks and use these velocity settings to cause them to collide. There is no friction between the pucks and the shuffleboard, but the pucks stop moving when they fall off the edge. ","Using the activity, answer a question: Is it possible for an object to have negative momentum? If so, how can you achieve it? "],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_8_0"]}
