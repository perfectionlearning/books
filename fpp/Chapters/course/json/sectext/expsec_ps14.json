","In the first equation, we use the number of moles of gas when we write the equation. The equation states the ideal gas law: the pressure times the volume equals  the product of the number of moles of gas, the gas constant, and the Kelvin temperature of the gas. The pressure is the absolute pressure, which must be stated in pascals.  The gas constant <i>R</i> is 8.31 joules per mole-kelvin.","In the second equation, the number of particles is used instead of the number of moles, which is represented by <i>N</i> in the equation, instead of <i>n</i>, the quantity measured in moles. The constant <i>k</i>, Boltzmann's constant, is used instead of <i>R</i>. Boltzmann's constant is the gas constant divided by Avogadro’s number."],"objNames":["wb_ideal_gas_moles_equation","wb_ideal_gas_particles_equation"]}
