","If the combining pulses have displacements with opposite signs, as is the case with the peak and trough in the diagram, then when they meet, the resulting displacement is smaller in magnitude than that of either pulse. In our example, the two pulses have exactly the same size and shape but opposite displacements. ","When the locations of the pulses overlap, the sum of their displacements is zero at all points and the string is momentarily flat. You can see their overlap at <i>t<\/i> = 2.5 seconds, with the result being a flat line."],"objNames":["wb_superposition_concepts2"]}
