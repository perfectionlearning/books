","A reference frame is a set of coordinates for making measurements.  It is based on how an observer \u201csees\u201d (measures) the motion.  For instance, the woman here, Joan, uses the surface of Earth as her reference frame. ","Joan considers herself, and the train platform she stands on, to be stationary, or unmoving.  She would measure her own velocity as zero. She observes the train moving by, and she would measure its velocity as a positive value.  ","Now we consider motion from Ted\u2019s point of view. Ted, on the train, uses it as his reference frame. He sees the other people in the train as stationary. He would measure his own velocity as zero, even though Joan measures his velocity as a positive value. ","The crucial point is that a person naturally sees and measures motion based on his own reference frame. There is no right or wrong reference frame \u2212 one just has to be clear about which reference frame is being used to measure motion."],"objNames":["wb_reference_frame_1","wb_reference_frame_2"]}
