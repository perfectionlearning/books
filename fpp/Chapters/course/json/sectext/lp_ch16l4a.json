To determine the [OBJ:expsec_p373:equivalent resistance for resistors in series], sum the resistances of the resistors. The [OBJ:expsec_p372:current] in series wiring remains the same throughout the circuit.<br />2. To determine the [OBJ:expsec_p376:equivalent resistance for resistors in parallel], the reciprocal of the equivalent resistance is the sum of the reciprocals of the resistances of the resistors. The [OBJ:expsec_p375:current] in parallel wiring is conserved, but splits and rejoins at junctions in the circuit.","  <b>Vocabulary:</b>  [OBJ:expsec_p372:series wiring], [OBJ:expsec_p373:equivalent resistance], [OBJ:expsec_p375:parallel wiring]","  <b>STEM Skills:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1.
