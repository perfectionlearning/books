The latent heat for changing state between solid and liquid is different than that for changing between liquid and gas. ","Transforming from a solid to a liquid, or from liquid to solid, requires an amount of heat per kilogram called the latent heat of fusion.","Transforming from a liquid to a gas, or vice versa, requires an amount of heat flow per kilogram called the “latent heat of vaporization.” ","The latent heat values are the same in either “direction” of state change. When a given amount of gas turns into a liquid, as much heat flows out as had to flow in to convert the liquid to a gas. The same applies to state changes between liquid and solid.  However, the latent heat of vaporization is not the same as the latent heat of fusion for a material."],"objNames":["wb_latent_heat_concepts","wb_latent_heat_concepts2"]}
