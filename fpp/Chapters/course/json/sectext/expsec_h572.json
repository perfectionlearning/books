All these orbits are near-circular − they are only slightly elliptical (oval).","You can see that bodies farther from the Sun move more slowly.  Radius is one factor in orbital speed. ","Another factor is the mass of the body being orbited.   The mass of Earth is a factor in the Moon’s orbital speed, as is the Sun’s in Earth’s orbital speed.","The equation reflects the points made previously: the orbital speed increases with the square root of the mass of the body being orbited, and decreases with the square root of the radius of the orbit.  The mass of the <u>satellite</u>, the object doing the orbiting, does not matter. "],"objNames":["wb_table_circular_orbit","wb_circular_orbit_equation"]}
