In science, conservation means something remains constant.  It does not increase or decrease.","Momentum is conserved in an isolated system.  A classic example of momentum being conserved is two pool balls colliding. The balls are moving with different velocities before and after the collision. But if we sum their momentums before the collision, the sum equals the total momentum after the collision.","As with conservation of energy, we assume the system is isolated.  There are no external forces acting on it, just the forces between the two balls as they collide. If a net external force acts on a system \u2212 such as if a player strikes one of the balls with the cue stick \u2212 then the system\u2019s momentum will change.","In short, momentum is conserved in an isolated system. We write this as the equation you see: the initial momentum equals the final momentum."],"objNames":["wb_conservation_of_momentum_concept","wb_conservation_of_momentum_equation"]}
