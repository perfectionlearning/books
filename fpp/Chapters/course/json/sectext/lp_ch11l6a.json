[OBJ:expsec_k484:Conduction] is the heat transfer due to contact within or between objects. <br />2. [OBJ:expsec_k486:Convection] is the heat transfer due to motion of molecules within fluids. An example of convection is warm air rising.<br />3. [OBJ:expsec_k4872331:Electromagnetic radiation] is the transfer of energy by electric and magnetic fields. An example of electromagnetic radiation is the [OBJ:expsec_k488:Sun's energy] heating [OBJ:expsec_k489:Earth's atmosphere].<br />4. [OBJ:expsec_k48722:Conduction, convection, and electromagnetic radiation] all deal with the idea of heat transfer, but vary in how heat is transferred.","  <b>Vocabulary:</b>  [OBJ:expsec_k484:conduction], [OBJ:expsec_k486:convection], [OBJ:expsec_k4872331:electromagnetic radiation], [OBJ:expsec_k489:global warming]"],"objNames":["wb_contrast_thermal_processes"]}
