[OBJ:expsec_q775:Electromagnetic induction] is the generation of an electromotor force (emf) by the movement of a conductor through a magnetic field. <br />2. The [OBJ:expsec_q776:emf] produced by electromagnetic induction on a coil is dependent on several factors: the strength of the magnet, the speed of the magnet through the coil, the area of the loop created by the coil, and the number of loops. <br />3. [OBJ:expsec_q778:Magnetic flux] is the product of the magnetic field and the area through which the field is passing. Flux is used to calculate electromagnetic induction. <br />4. [OBJ:expsec_q779:Faraday's law] explains how to calculate an emf induced by electromagnetic induction. Divide magnetic flux by elapsed time.","  <b>Vocabulary:</b>  [OBJ:expsec_q775:electromagnetic induction], [OBJ:expsec_q779:Faraday's law]","  <b>STEM Skills:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1.
