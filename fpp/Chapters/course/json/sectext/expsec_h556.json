","Uniform circular motion is motion along a circular path at a constant speed.  Uniform means \u201cconstant.\u201d  The constant speed is represented by the fact that the length of the velocity vector arrow stays the same. The length of the arrow reflects the magnitude of the velocity vector (speed). ","The velocity of the toy is not constant.  It changes every instant, because the car is changing direction. The changing direction of the velocity vector shows that the velocity is changing.  ","To emphasize the point, velocity is both speed and direction.  When the direction changes, the velocity changes, even as the speed is constant. This change in velocity is a specific form of acceleration, called <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_centripetal_acceleration_concept'>centripetal acceleration<\/a>, which is a later topic."],"objNames":["wb_UCM_concept"]}
