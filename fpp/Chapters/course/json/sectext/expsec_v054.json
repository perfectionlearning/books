","There are about 120 elements, including carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and so on. An element cannot be broken down using ordinary chemical methods. Each element has different physical and chemical properties, such as density, specific heat, and the way in which it combines with other elements. ","An atom is the smallest part of an element that exhibits the element\u2019s chemical properties. Atoms are very small. For example, 12 grams (about 5.3 cubic centimeters) of carbon has approximately 6.03\u00d710<sup class=\"\">23<\/sup> atoms. ","The diagrams show the basic arrangement of the particles that make up a carbon atom, which is typical of the overall configuration of an atom. An atom has a positively charged nucleus at its center. The nucleus is composed of positively charged particles called protons and neutral particles called neutrons. The gray spheres represent neutrons. ","Atoms have negatively charged electrons that are outside the nucleus. The black spheres represent electrons. With a neutral atom, the magnitude of the electrons\u2019 total negative charge equals the magnitude of the total amount of positive charge of the protons.
