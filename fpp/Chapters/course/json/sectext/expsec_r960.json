Peak meets trough, and trough meets peak. The waves are out of phase. Using superposition, we can add the waves and you can see the result.  ","In this example of complete destructive interference, the waves cancel each other \u2212 the result would be an area of calm if the waves were water waves or complete darkness if they were light waves.  ","In the lower diagram, two waves are in phase when they leave the slits, but completely out of phase when they reach the screen because they travel different distances to that point on the screen. Peak meets trough and trough meets peak there, and the result is destructive interference.  ","The result is a dark band in the interference pattern.  At the center of the band, there is complete destructive interference, resulting in the darkest location.  As we move out from the center, there is partial destructive interference. The waves are not perfectly out of phase \u2212 peak does not exactly overlap with trough \u2212 but still they partially cancel, to form a relatively dim region.
