The maximum distance from equilibrium stays the same. ","It also returns to its peak or trough position in equal amounts of time.  A peak is one extreme of motion and the trough is the other. The motion is periodic: It has a consistently repeating pattern over time."],"objNames":["wb_SHM_graph_no_trig"]}
