    "When you click on the graphic on the left, you drive a car around a city. This activity marks your start to physics in two dimensions.  ",
    "You control the car using the arrow keys.  The up and down keys control your speed − up is your accelerator, and down is your brake.  (It’s sort of a funny brake − if you press it long enough, then you will go in the opposite direction…).  The left and right arrow keys turn the car left and right.  ",
    "The gauges are as important as the steering wheel.  Your car has velocity gauges for motion in each direction − along the <br><i>x</i>-axis and the <i>y</i>-axis.  ",
    "You start at the origin, 0 X-street and 0 Y-avenue.  As you drive, you will see the X-street and Y-avenue numbers change as they would on a standard coordinate graph. ",
    "A few questions:  If you move directly along a Y-avenue, what is your <i>x</i>-velocity?  your <i>y</i>-velocity?  Also answer these questions for motion directly along an X-street.  How about your speed when you are moving around a curve − does it equal the sum of the velocity vectors, or something else? "
