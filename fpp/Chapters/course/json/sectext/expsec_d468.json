","Two factors determine a projectile\u2019s motion.  One is its initial velocity.   In the first example, we just drop a cannonball, so its initial velocity is zero.    ","The cannonball falls to Earth.  Its vertical velocity changes because gravity is pulling it toward Earth. Vertically, it accelerates at \u2212<i>g<\/i>, freefall acceleration.  The sign indicates its direction. (When discussing projectile motion, we often <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_air_resistance_concept2'>ignore air resistance<\/a>.) Its vertical velocity becomes more and more negative as the projectile falls to the ground.

But what is an example of non-projectile motion?  An airplane is such an example \u2212 in addition to freefall acceleration, its motion is determined by its engines and other factors, and we cannot ignore the effects on the plane of the air around it.
