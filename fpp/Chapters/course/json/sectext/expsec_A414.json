With animal tracks, factors such as size and shape of the marks, length of stride, overall pattern, and direction and depth of the prints can reveal the type of animal that made them. Particles leave telltale signs in detectors in a similar manner for physicists to study.","Particle accelerators generate enormous amounts of data.  For example, the data recorded by each of the big experiments at the Large Hadron Collider is enough to fill about 100,000 DVDs every year.  ","The challenge of analyzing this data is beyond the capability of any single computer or supercomputer.  Instead, the scientists use a global computing system called the Grid. This is a form of distributed computing, where computers located all over the world can be accessed via the Internet to create shared processing power. This method of resource sharing creates a single huge and powerful computer to benefit all of the network collaborators."],"objNames":["wb_particle_accelerator_4"]}
