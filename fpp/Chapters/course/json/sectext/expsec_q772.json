","To discuss the force between wires, we use two parallel wires with currents flowing in the same direction in both wires. The upper illustration also shows the magnetic field due to the current in the bottom wire. You should check the direction of the magnetic field with the right-hand rule for currents. ","The magnetic field from each wire intersects the other wire.  Since each wire contains current, which is made up of moving charges, each magnetic field will apply a force on the other wire.","The lower diagram shows the force applied by the magnetic field of the lower wire on the current in the upper wire.  The conventional (positive) current is moving to the left in that wire.  We show the negative electrons toward the right. ","The force is downward, as you can confirm by applying the right-hand rule for the magnetic force on a moving charged particle.  The field causes the wire to move toward the other wire. ","When we determine the direction of the force the magnetic field of the upper wire applies on the current in the lower wire, we see it is upward. These two currents, flowing in the same direction, form magnetic fields which exert forces that pull the wires together. "],"objNames":["wb_2wires_bfields_concepts1","wb_2wires_bfields_concepts2"]}
