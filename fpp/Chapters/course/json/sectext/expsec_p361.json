Capacitors store charge.    ","A capacitor is made up of two conductors, like the plates we show. An insulator, such as air, separates the surfaces.","When the plates are charged, there is a potential difference across them. The charges on the plates are equal in amount but opposite in sign. ","Capacitance for a capacitor is analogous to resistance for a resistor − it is the component’s fundamental measure.  The capacitance is the (positive) amount of charge divided by the potential difference.  If a capacitor has a high capacitance, it takes relatively little potential difference to store a good amount of charge. The unit for capacitance is the farad, represented with capital F.
