Einstein explained data from a sophisticated version of this experiment, known as the photoelectric effect, to earn his Nobel Prize.","Scientists had noticed that when they shined a beam of light on a metal, electrons were released from the illuminated surface. This was not particularly surprising: The energy of the light was transferred to the electrons, allowing some of them to escape the metal.","The emission of electrons could be explained by classical physics − or so it would appear. Light was a wave with energy, and that energy could provide a “kick” to electrons as the metal absorbed the light. However, the details of the photoelectric effect were utterly surprising and could not be explained by classical physics.","Some parts of the electromagnetic spectrum,  such as red light, could not eject electrons from the surface, no matter how bright (intense) the beam was. On the other hand, other colors, such as violet, were effective at ejecting electrons from the metal surface, even when the beam intensity was very low.","To study the photoelectric effect, start the simulation with the light set to LOW. Only one color of light will cause electrons to escape the metal being used in our simulation. Red light has a longer wavelength but a lower frequency than violet light. Which of the two colors of light do you think will cause electrons to be emitted? Why?","Now set the intensity of the light to HIGH, and try both colors again. What do you expect will change when you make this change? What do you think will stay the same?"],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_41_0"]}
