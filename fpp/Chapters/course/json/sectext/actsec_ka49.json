You see the situation: a block is being pulled horizontally, on a rough surface, by a rope. The block accelerates to the right at 11 m\/s<sup class=\"\">2<\/sup>. In the simulation, the force vectors on the block are drawn, but each one initially points in the wrong direction, has the wrong magnitude, or both.","Your job is to fix the force vectors. You do this by dragging the heads of the vectors to point in the correct direction. (To simplify your work, they \u201csnap\u201d to vertical and horizontal orientations, but you do need to drag them close before they will snap.) You change both their lengths (which determine their magnitudes) and their directions by dragging."],"objNames":["wb_Chapter_5_15","jsact_Chapter_5_15"]}
