We use the example of a car.   ","The car starts driving at Chester and ends at Dunsville.  It is 100 km in a straight line between the two cities. The car heads roughly southeast, along a winding road.  A vector arrow indicates the direction and distance of the car\u2019s net displacement. ","A different car drives from Acme to Dunsville.  It heads roughly east. Again, a vector arrow indicates the direction and distance of the car\u2019s net displacement.  ","As always, the length of the arrow representing the vector is proportional to its magnitude.  Longer arrows represent greater magnitudes.   The larger displacement between Acme and Dunsville is indicated by a longer arrow. "],"objNames":["wb_math_vector_coordinates"]}
