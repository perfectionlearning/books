[OBJ:expsec_h577:Kepler's first law] states that planets move in elliptical orbits around the Sun. The Sun is at one focus of the ellipse.<br />2. [OBJ:expsec_h578:Kepler's second law] states that planets sweep out equal areas in equal amounts of time.<br />3. [OBJ:expsec_h579:Kepler's third law] states that the period of planets A and B squared is equal to the average distance to the Sun of planets A and B cubed.<br />4. [OBJ:expsec_h579i:Orbital energy] can be calculated using the gravitational constant, masses of the objects, and orbit radius.<br />5. Our understanding of [OBJ:expsec_zr79:gravity] has evolved with the help of Sir Isaac Newton, Johannes Kepler, Galileo, and Einstein.","  <b>Vocabulary:</b>  [OBJ:expsec_h577:the law of orbits], [OBJ:expsec_h577:the law of areas], [OBJ:expsec_h579:the law of periods]","  <b>STEM Skills:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1.
