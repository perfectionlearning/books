For an explanation of how to incorporate Science Notebooks into your instruction, see Chapter 1 Overview, Part 1.","  <b>Group Activity: Exam Questions</b> Divide the class into six groups. Each group will be responsible for one lesson in the chapter. (Group 3 will combine Lessons 3 and 4). Ask each member of the group to independently write a question on their assigned lesson that could be used as an exam question for the class. Be sure they also write an answer. As a group, students then discuss which questions best suit the material. Also, they should decide on the best answer. Remind students to be respectful of each personâ€™s ideas. Next, have each group present a short summary of the lesson to the class. Finally, as a class, review the student-written questions and answers.","If your students have access to a file-sharing program, you may wish to have them submit the best questions and answers to the shared site so that the class can then use them as a study guide. Questions and answers can then be further improved as new information is learned."],"objNames":[]}
