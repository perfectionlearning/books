You are experiencing a reaction force called static friction. As you push harder and harder, the amount of static friction increases to exactly equal the magnitude of your horizontal force, until the box finally begins to slide. ","If you push hard enough to exceed the maximum amount of static friction, the box will slide, and you are now experiencing kinetic friction. ","Kinetic friction occurs when two objects slide past each other. Kinetic friction always acts in the direction opposite the direction of motion.
