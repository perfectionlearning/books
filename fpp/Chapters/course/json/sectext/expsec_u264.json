We show a light wave crossing the boundary between two materials, traveling from top to bottom. The wave slows as it enters the second material, a material with a greater refractive index. ","The animation shows that the frequency of the light stays the same. If it did not, then waves would either \u201cpile up\u201d at the interface, or be destroyed. Neither occurs. You can confirm this in the animation by observing the frequency of the waves as they enter and exit the frame \u2212 it is the same. ","On the other hand, the wavelength does change, as you can observe in the illustration.  The peaks being closer to one another in the second material indicates a smaller wavelength. ","The equation we show states that the wavelength of light in a medium is inversely proportional to the index of refraction in the medium. For example, water has a larger index of refraction than air, which means light travels more slowly in water than in air. The wavelength of a light wave in water is less than its wavelength in air. The example we show in this section could be light passing from air to water, since the wavelength is reduced in the second medium.
