And in some cases, the questions cannot be answered by science because the answer lies in the field of ethics.  Ethical questions are answered by peoplesâ€™ values, philosophies, and beliefs. Science has a role in contributing to ethical decisions, but science alone cannot decide ethical questions. ","The tradeoff between nuclear power and coal power is usually stated as the risks of storing nuclear waste for thousands or tens of thousands of years versus the air pollution caused by burning coal. For the sake of discussion, we assume the choice has to be made between only these two resources. ","Scientists can help in this discussion.  They can measure how much air pollution is created by burning coal.  They can analyze how likely it is that nuclear waste will cause damage. They can assess the damage created by the Fukushima tsunami reactor disaster. ","However, deciding between nuclear power versus coal power is in part an ethical question.  Balancing short-term damage versus long-term risk is in part a question of ethics.  No science experiment can decide this.  Ethics rely on human values."],"objNames":["wb_sci_ethics"]}
