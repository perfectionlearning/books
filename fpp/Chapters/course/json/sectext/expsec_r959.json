To explain this, we use a light wave.  First, the waves typically must be of one frequency and wavelength. For light, this means monochromatic, which means of one color.","In addition, the waves must be coherent. Coherent wave sources can produce waves with all of the waves vibrating in phase, and they have fixed phase differences between the waves they generate.  A laser is a typical source of monochromatic, coherent light.  Coherent wave sources can produce interference patterns, like the pattern we showed earlier. ","An incoherent wave source has changing phase differences in the waves it produces. A typical light bulb is a classic example of a source of incoherent light.  The phase differences among the light waves emitted by a bulb vary randomly over time.  Waves from bulbs can interfere, but the random nature of their phase differences means that no stable interference pattern results."],"objNames":["wb_interference_intro2","wb_interference_intro3"]}
