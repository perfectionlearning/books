Why? First, interference experiments were important in demonstrating the wavelike property of light.  Second, the interference patterns produced by light provide striking examples of interference.","The photograph in the upper diagram shows a light interference pattern.  This pattern results when light from a single source passes through two slits and then reaches a viewing screen, as shown in the lower diagram.  The pattern suggests that light has properties we associate with waves, since water waves passing through slits could create a similar pattern. The result is the bands you see, with bright red light bands separated by dark bands. ","Why does light produce this interference pattern of light and dark bands? The English scientist Thomas Young was the first to explain the pattern, starting in 1801 with a series of experiments that demonstrated the wavelike nature of light.  ","Young shined light at a pair of barriers containing parallel slits to create the light interference pattern. The slits were small, with a width comparable to the wavelength of the light. The light traveled through two parallel slits, and the waves that came through each slit combined along the viewing screen.  The result was the interference pattern, similar to the one you see in the upper diagram.","When he saw the interference pattern, Young realized he had shown that light had wavelike properties.  He knew this because a similar setup could create an interference pattern with water waves.  "],"objNames":["wb_interference_concepts1","wb_interference_concepts1a"]}
