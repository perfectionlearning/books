","Many organ pipes have two open ends.  The different pipe lengths mean that notes of different fundamental frequencies, and harmonics, can be created.  The pipes typically can be shut (\u201cstopped\u201d) at one end for even more possibilities. ","A flute is another example of an instrument with two open ends.  Pressing the keys creates different tube lengths within the instrument, which in turn means different resonant frequencies.   ","A soda bottle is a simple example of a closed-end musical instrument.  The clarinet is another example. Changing the height of the water in the soda bottle changes the effective length of the column of air that resonates, which changes the frequency of the harmonics.  The frequency of the sound from the bottle changes as the water heights change. ","More specifically, changing the water height changes the possible resonant frequencies of standing waves.  The system responds strongly to sounds at the resonant frequency, making them much louder. Bottles such as these provide a simple way to investigate resonance in waves.
