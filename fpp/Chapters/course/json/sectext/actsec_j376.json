{"cards":[{"lines":[{"type":"title","text":"Eureka!?!"}]}],"definitions":[],"secText":["In this simulation, you play the role of the ancient Greek mathematician and physicist Archimedes. As the story goes, in olden Syracuse the tyrant Hiero suspected that a wily goldsmith had adulterated one of his kingly crowns during manufacture by replacing some of the precious gold with an equal weight of silver. His Royal Highness asked Archimedes to discover whether this was indeed the case.","Archimedes considered the problem for days. Then, one day, in the public bath, he observed how the water level in the pool rose as he eased himself in for a good soak, and suddenly realized that the answer was right in front of his eyes. Overjoyed, he supposedly leapt from the bath and ran dripping through the streets of the city crying “Eureka!” (I have found it!) The “impure” crown was quickly identified, and the goldsmith roundly punished.","Your task is to determine the nature of Archimedes’ insight and apply it in the simulation to the left. You have two crowns and a bar of pure gold. You have already measured their masses using a balance scale. You can measure the volume of a crown or bar in the simulation by dragging it to the bath and noting how much water it displaces. You see the tube that measures the displaced liquid in the illustration at the right. Decide which crown has been altered and drag it to the king’s palace. The appropriate consequences will occur!"],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_14_14"]}
