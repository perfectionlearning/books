Some basic concepts of geology are required to explain how physics is relevant.","One concept is the basic model of the Earth.  The Earth is made up of three layers: the crust, the mantle, and the core.  We walk on the top layer of the crust every day, and oceans and lakes also sit on the ocean crust.  It is relatively thin (by Earth standards) − it is from 7 to 70 kilometers thick, thickest in mountainous regions such as the Himalayas and thinnest on the ocean floor. It is primarily composed of rocks.","Below the crust is the mantle. It extends about 2900 kilometers below the crust and makes up a little over 80% of the Earth’s volume. One of the mantle’s primary differences from the crust is the rocks that make it up.  At its top level it contains rocks with relatively heavy concentrations of iron and magnesium.  At lower depths of the mantle, temperatures are above the rock’s melting point, and this enables the rocks to flow very, very slowly.","At the center of the Earth is the core, a very hot region of great density due to the pressure from the layers above.  Part is fluid (caused by the high temperatures), but most of the inner core is solid (due to the great pressure).   To say “very hot” seems almost an understatement − the core reaches temperatures of 6,000° Celsius, which is the same as the temperature of the Sun’s surface! "],"objNames":["wb_geo_heat_1"]}
