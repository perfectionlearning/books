","On Earth during the middle of the day, the approximately vertical rays of the Sun pass through about 100 kilometers of atmosphere. ","The scattering of the Sun’s light creates the blue glow of the sky. Since electrons resonate more with blue light than with red light, they scatter more light at the blue end of the spectrum. In fact, blue light scatters about ten times more than red light. If red light scattered more than blue, then you would see a red sky. ","With the bluest light scattered to the sides, the visible disk of the Sun is produced by the remaining wavelengths of light in the spectrum, a portion centered on yellow. The Sun appears yellowish white. "],"objNames":["wb_sky_blue_concepts2a","wb_sky_blue_concepts2"]}
