[OBJ:expsec_e761:Mass] is the property that a body has that causes it to resist acceleration.<br />2. [OBJ:expsec_e762:Newton's second law] states that net force is equal to mass multiplied by acceleration. Acceleration is in the direction of the net force.<br />3. [OBJ:expsec_e779:Equilibrium] is reached when there is no net force (and therefore no net acceleration) on an object.<br />4. [OBJ:expsec_b776:Motion equations] can be used to [OBJ:app_forceonfighter_question:solve for acceleration]. Acceleration can then be substituted into Newton's second law to solve for mass or net force.","  <b>Vocabulary:</b>  [OBJ:expsec_e761:mass], [OBJ:expsec_e762:Newton's second law], [OBJ:expsec_e779:equilibrium]","  <b>STEM Skills:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1.
