It is as cold as it gets.","Absolute zero is the temperature at which all molecular activity stops. You see a photograph of two physicists who caused atoms to be in a state of matter called a Bose-Einstein condensate. The temperature of the atoms is less than a hundred-billionth of a degree above absolute zero. ","Scientific theory says it is not possible to cool anything to absolute zero, but the scientists got very, very close. We give them an \u201cA.\u201d ","Temperature scales such as Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin use reference points such as absolute zero to define the scale.","The triple point of water is another point scientists use to define temperature.  It is the only temperature and pressure combination at which ice, liquid water, and water vapor can exist simultaneously in equilibrium.  It equals 273.16 kelvins.  A unit in the Kelvin scale is written with a lowercase k, as in \u201ckelvin,\u201d but is abbreviated as an uppercase K.","After these temperature reference points are established, a temperature scale \u201cconnects the dots.\u201d  You see such a line in the lower diagram.
