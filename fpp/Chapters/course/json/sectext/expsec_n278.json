The locations in a standing wave that have no displacement are called “nodes.”  The locations of nodes are constant.  These are shown in the diagram with solid blue circles.","At other locations, particles vibrate at the maximum displacement − in other words, they are the locations of peaks and troughs. These locations are called “antinodes,” and these locations are constant as well. They are shown in the diagram with empty circles. "],"objNames":["wb_standing_waves_concepts2"]}
