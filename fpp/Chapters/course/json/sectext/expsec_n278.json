The locations in a standing wave that have no displacement are called \u201cnodes.\u201d  The locations of nodes are constant.  These are shown in the diagram with solid blue circles.","At other locations, particles vibrate at the maximum displacement \u2212 in other words, they are the locations of peaks and troughs.
