{"cards":[{"lines":[{"type":"title","text":"Creating images with reflection"}]}],"definitions":[],"secText":["This activity starts our discussion of mirrors, with a focus, so to speak, on the images they create. The design of many devices, from reading glasses to telescopes, depends on understanding how images are created.","The simulation features a concave mirror, one that curves around the object. You can move the penguin left and right, and observe how its position changes the location and size of the image. The image is shown as a faded-out version of the object itself. At some locations of the object, the image will be off the screen, but it will reappear when you move the object.","As you move the object, answer the following questions to predict the image formation. Where can you place the object so that the image and object are on the same side of the mirror? On opposite sides? Where can you place the object so that the image is smaller than the object? Larger? ","If you press the SHOW RAYS button in the simulation, you will see three light rays that start at the top of the penguin, reflect off the mirror, and converge (intersect) to define the top of the image. These rays are used in the study of mirrors and lenses, and this is your chance to begin to experience their properties. (The rays do not always converge perfectly. This is a realistic depiction of the way curved mirrors work.)"],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_35_0"]}
