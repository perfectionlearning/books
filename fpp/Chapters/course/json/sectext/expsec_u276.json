The behavior of the lens can explain phenomena such as nearsightedness. ","In the diagram, you see several parts of the human eye, including the cornea, the lens, and the ciliary muscle. The cornea is a transparent membrane forming the front surface of the eyeball. The ciliary muscle can change the curvature of the lens, causing its focal length to change. This allows the eye to focus objects at different distances at the same point behind the lens.","Notice the retina at the back of the eye. After light passes through the lens, a real image is focused on this \u201cscreen.\u201d When light in the real image stimulates the retina, electrical impulses travel through the optic nerve to the brain.
