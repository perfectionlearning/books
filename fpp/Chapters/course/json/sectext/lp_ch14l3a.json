When both a sound source and listener are moving [OBJ:expsec_n266:toward] or [OBJ:expsec_n267:away] from each other, the sound frequency is different from the perspective of the source and listener.<br />2. If we know the listener frequency, sound frequency, speed of source, speed of sound,  and speed of listener, we can calculate what occurs when the [OBJ:expsec_n269:listener moves] toward or away from the sound source, when the [OBJ:expsec_n268:sound source moves] toward or away from the listener, or both move at the same time.
