But a scientist will view other questions as outside the domain of science.  In this section, we discuss different types of questions and answers.  Some are part of science and others are not.","What determines the amount of gravitational force between two particles?  This is a science question. Scientists could consider factors like mass and distance and create hypotheses that can be tested.   Their hypothesis would include a mathematical model that relates force, distance and mass. Scientists will agree with a theory based on observational data and logical reasoning, in this case a mathematical model that predicts the force as a function of mass and distance.","What is the best flavor of ice cream? Although the writing team here believes it is cookie-dough ice cream, that is not a scientific answer or question.  For instance, how is “best” measured or defined?    There is no clear, testable hypothesis, and without that, no way to test its truth. "],"objNames":["wb_sci_limits"]}
