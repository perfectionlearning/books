As you can see in the first card, the professor is hanging from the tree, and the instant he sees the banana moving, he will drop from the tree in his eagerness to dine. He has a glove to catch the banana. No calculations are required to aim the banana correctly.","Can you correctly aim the monkey\u2019s bazooka so that the banana reaches the professor\u2019s glove as he falls? Aim it using the vector arrow.  Should you aim the shot above, below, or directly at the professor? As long as the banana is fired fast enough to reach the professor before it hits the ground, does its initial speed matter? ","In the second activity, the monkey is on the ground.  Another hungry professor drops from the tree the instant the banana leaves the tip of the bazooka. (Are professors paid enough? Answer: No.)","Can you correctly aim the banana so that it hits the professor\u2019s glove as she falls? Aim the banana using the vector arrow.
