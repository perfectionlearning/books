As we did before manually, we calculate the area of rectangles to approximate the area under a curve.<br />We start with the area of one rectangle.  We will use an example of a rectangle that is between the points on the curve described by the cells B17 and B18.  ","To calculate the area of a rectangle, we average the values of the curve at two points, and multiply that by the width.  In other words, the equation for those points would be ((B17 + B18))/2 * B$2, with B$2 being the interval, and B17 and B18 two points on the curve.   ","We average the two values to get the average height of the curve at that point.  That multiplied by the interval means we are multiplying a height by a base, and getting the area of a rectangle.  (The $ symbol means that Excel will always look in that cell, and not go down to B3, B4, and so on, as we go down rows.)","To calculate a probability of a range, we sum rectangles.  In our example spreadsheet, column D has the area of each rectangle, and column E has the cumulative values.  For instance, the probability of the value of <i>x</i> being between 0 and 1.1 is approximated as 0.27180745, the value shown in column E for 1.1. <b>You can see the example spreadsheet here.</b>","Also, graphing calculators can perform similar calculations.
