Two objects are in thermal equilibrium when the flow of heat is equal in each direction. There is no net heat flow.","Two objects in thermal equilibrium have the same temperature. Equilibrium may take some time to occur âˆ’ for instance, with traditional thermometers, it takes a while for the substance and the thermometer to reach thermal equilibrium.  At that point, the thermometer reports the temperature of the substance it is measuring. "],"objNames":["wb_thermal_equilibrium_concepts"]}
