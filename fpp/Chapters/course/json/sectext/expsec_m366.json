","Whales sing in the ocean.  They have a range of sound frequencies, but a typical frequency would be about 25 Hz. In other words, they sing at 25 cycles per second.","The human voice has a range of frequencies too, and a range of 100 to 1,000 Hz is typical.  For those who are musicians: The A above middle C has a frequency of 440 Hz.","A typical AM radio frequency would be about 1,000,000 Hz.  For instance, a radio station that is 950 on the dial is broadcasting at 950 kHz, or 950,000 Hz.   FM stations broadcast in the 100,000,000 Hz range.","Computers now operate at frequencies greater than 1,000,000,000 Hz.  You will see this written typically in gigahertz, such as a 4.5 GHz microprocessor. Light has a frequency on the order of magnitude of 1Ã—10<sup class=\"\">15</sup> Hz."],"objNames":["wb_table_frequency_example"]}
