{"cards":[{"lines":[{"type":"title","text":"Geosynchronous orbit"}]}],"definitions":[],"secText":["In this simulation, your mission is to put a satellite into a circular geosynchronous orbit around Earth. A geosynchronous orbit is one in which the satellite’s orbital period is 24 hours, the same as Earth’s rotational period. If located over the equator, a geosynchronous satellite keeps pace with the Earth’s rotation and hovers over the same location, a requirement for some communications satellites.","What orbital radius and orbital speed must you set for the satellite so that it achieves a circular, geosynchronous orbit? You need to determine a speed that will cause the satellite to remain over a fixed point above Earth. (Hint: There are 24 hours in a day….) Kepler’s third law will help you determine the orbital radius.","This simulation contains an added complication: You need to factor in Earth’s motion. Earth supplies a tangential velocity of 460 m/s to satellites launched from the equator, and the rocket launches in the direction that allows it to take advantage of that “boost.” In short, you must subtract 460 m/s from whatever you have determined is the orbital speed needed for a geosynchronous orbit. The ship will maneuver appropriately as it moves to the radius orbit you specified."],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_13_20"]}
