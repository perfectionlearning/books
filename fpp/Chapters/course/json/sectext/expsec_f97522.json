We use the example of a 0.5-kilogram model rocket that is launched straight up in the air, at an initial velocity of 50 meters per second.  We assume that the rocket is an isolated system, using the definition above. ","It starts with zero potential energy, since it is on the ground.  Its potential energy increases until it gains its maximum height of 128 meters, since gravitational <i>PE</i> equals <i>mgh</i>. It then falls to the ground, and when it hits the ground at 10.2 seconds, its height is 0, so its <i>PE</i> is again 0. We have described the highlights of a gravitational potential energy graph. ","The kinetic energy of the projectile starts at a maximum, since the rocket’s speed is at its maximum.  It reaches its peak height at 5.1 seconds, and its speed there is 0, as its motion changes from rising to falling.  It falls back to the ground, and again reaches its maximum speed.  Its <i>KE</i> (proportional to the square of its velocity) is at the maximum at the beginning and end, and is zero when at the peak, when its speed is zero. This <i>KE</i> graph is also a parabola, the mirror image of the <i>PE</i> graph.","We sum the curves to find the total energy curve.  The total energy is always the same − 625 joules.  In our example (in which we ignore air resistance), the total energy is constant − it is conserved. "],"objNames":["wb_conservation_energy_graph"]}
