[OBJ:expsec_i969:Net torque] can be calculated by multiplying the moment of inertia by the angular acceleration of an object.<br />2. The [OBJ:expsec_i970:moment of inertia] of an object is the sum of the mass of each particle in an object multiplied by the particle’s distance squared from the axis of rotation.<br />3. The moment of inertia can be calculated for [OBJ:expsec_i972:common shapes] such as sphere, cylinders, and rods.","  <b>Vocabulary:</b>  [OBJ:expsec_i969:moment of inertia]","  <b>STEM Skills:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1.
