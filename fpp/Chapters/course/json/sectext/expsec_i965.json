Rotational dynamics is the study of the effect of torque on rotational motion.  Torque can cause an object to rotate, or change the rate of rotation of an object. Here, the torque applied by the hand causes the wrench to rotate.","The amount of torque depends in part on the amount of force. When the hand supplies a larger force, there is more torque.","Torque also depends on the distance between the axis of rotation and the point where the force is applied. An object rotates around its axis of rotation. When a force is applied at a greater distance from the axis, there is more torque.","We start by discussing the case where the force is perpendicular to the line from the axis to the point where the force is applied.","The amount of torque equals the product of the amount of force and the distance from the axis. Torque is represented by the Greek letter <i>τ</i>. It is written as “tau” and rhymes with the word “how.”","The direction of the torque determines its sign.  Clockwise is negative, and counterclockwise is positive. ","The unit for torque is just the product of the typical units for force − the newton − and for distance − the meter.  No surprises here, except perhaps physicists not seizing the chance to name something after one of their own."],"objNames":["wb_torque_concepts","wb_torque_equation"]}
