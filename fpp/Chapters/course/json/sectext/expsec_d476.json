","We show a car with a displacement of 2.0 km. The length of the vector is proportional to its magnitude, as always.","The angle is the angle made with the positive <i>x</i>-axis, which is the usual way to describe an angle. Positive angles are measured in the counterclockwise direction. The angle in the upper diagram is 150°.","We show two examples of velocity vectors.  The first is velocity of <span class=\"math\">5 m/s</span> at 50°.  Its length, 5 m/s, is its magnitude.","The second velocity vector is <span class=\"math\">8 m/s</span> at 210°.
