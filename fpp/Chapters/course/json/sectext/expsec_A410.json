If a light source is moving away from the observer (or vice versa), the frequency decreases. This Doppler effect is called a “red shift” and is typically observed in our Universe, where the distance between Earth and most stars is increasing. ","We show the equation for the Doppler effect for light. ƒ<sub class=\"\">o</sub> is the proper frequency of the light as seen by an observer who is stationary relative to the light source.  ƒ is the frequency of light seen by an observer who is moving at <i>v</i>, relative to the source.  <i>v</i> is <b>positive</b> if the source and observer are separating, and <b>negative</b> if they are moving closer together.
