They do not have to be, of course, and in this section we show we can use trigonometry to cover the non-perpendicular cases. ","To calculate the component of the charge\u2019s velocity perpendicular to the field, we use the sine of the angle between the velocity and magnetic field vectors. That angle is shown in the diagram. It is the smaller, positive angle between the two vectors: 90\u00b0 in this case.  The charge is the magnitude of the charge, and the equation gives the magnitude of the magnetic force.  As always, the right-hand rule is used to calculate the direction of the force. ","Since the sine of 90\u00b0 is 1 the equation simplifies to <span class=\"math\"><i>F<\/i> = <i>qvB<\/i><\/span> in the case we show. If the two vectors were parallel, then the angle would be 0\u00b0 or 180\u00b0. Since the sine of those angles is 0, there is no force when velocity and magnetic field are parallel.","Similarly, we can use the sine of the angle between a section of wire with current and the magnetic field to calculate the force the magnetic field exerts on it.  As with the equation for the force on a charged particle, if the wire is perpendicular to the field, the equation simplifies to the one without the trigonometric function.  If the wire is parallel to the magnetic field, there is no force. "],"objNames":["wb_trig_bfield_charge","wb_trig_bfield_wire"]}
