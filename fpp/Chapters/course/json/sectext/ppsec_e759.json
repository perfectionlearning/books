After all, mostly what we see are things changing their velocity.  For instance, a soccer ball will stop rolling a while after it is kicked.   ","Athletes know about Newton’s first law, if not by name.  The skier we show wants to go as fast as possible and will work to reduce forces that will slow him down.","The skier wears a tight suit and curls up in a ball, to reduce the force of air resistance upon him that slows him down.  He also waxes his skies to reduce friction.  ","If he could cause those forces to be zero, the skier would continue at the same velocity forever on a flat surface.
