Gravity is a force that exists between every pair of particles, of any mass, in the universe. It pulls the particles together. It does not require contact.","Earth and the satellite apply a gravitational force on each other. Each attracts the other with an equal amount of force, as we know from Newton’s third law. ","The gravitational force between the bodies is proportional to the product of their masses. The force shown here between Earth and the satellite is quite large compared to the force between, say, a pair of tennis balls separated by the same distance.","The force between two bodies decreases with the square of the distance between them. The farther the satellite is from Earth, the less the force of gravity it experiences. For spherical objects, distance is measured between the centers of the objects.","You see <i>G</i>, the gravitational constant, in the equation. As you can see, it is small. Even though objects around you attract you gravitationally, you do not feel their gravity. Large amounts of mass − like that of Earth − are required to create forces that we can feel.
