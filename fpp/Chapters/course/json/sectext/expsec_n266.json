","When the source of the sound moves toward a listener, as in the second diagram, each successive sound wave is emitted from a point that is a bit closer to the listener. The effect for the listener is that the sound wave fronts arrive closer together. ","Because the wave fronts arrive closer together, the listener hears more cycles per second than before. The wave has a higher frequency, so the listener hears a higher pitch. You can investigate the Doppler effect for yourself by listening to moving sound sources such as a train, fire truck, and so on.
