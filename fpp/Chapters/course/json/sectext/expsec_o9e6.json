It is the molecular structure of the water molecule, as well as the way the molecules bond and arrange themselves, that explains much of water\u2019s unique qualities.","The two hydrogen atoms and the oxygen atom that make up water share electrons. This creates the bonds that keep them together.","This causes the hydrogen side to be positively charged and the oxygen side to be negatively charged.","A solvent is a substance that can dissolve other substances.  Water is a versatile solvent \u2212 it can dissolve many solids. ","Why is water a good solvent? Water\u2019s partially charged sides \u201cpull\u201d the oppositely charged particles of a solid into a solution.  For instance, water dissolves table salt, the salt you use to season food, melting the solid salt into liquid water.  ","It dissolves the salt because the salt is made up of positively charged sodium (Na) ions and negatively charged chlorine (Cl) ions. Water pulls apart the elements that make up the salt crystal."],"objNames":["wb_watersolvent_concepts1","wb_watersolvent_concepts2"]}
