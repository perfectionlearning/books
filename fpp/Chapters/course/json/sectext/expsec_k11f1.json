For instance, radioactive materials decay exponentially, with the amount of radioactive material repeatedly being cut in half after a fixed period of time, called the half-life of the material. After each additional half-life period, there is half as much radioactive material as before.","Radioactive iodine, I-131, is used to treat thyroid disease. It has a half-life of 8 days, which means that after 8 days, the amount of I-131 is half the original amount. After 16 days, only one quarter of the original amount is left, after 24 days, one-eighth is left, and so on.","The equation <i>y<\/i> = (1\/2)<sup class=\"\">x<\/sup><sup class=\"\">\/8<\/sup>  states the proportion of the original amount of I-131 remaining after <i>x<\/i> days.
