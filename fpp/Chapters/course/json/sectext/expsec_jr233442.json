The person is fired at an initial velocity, that is, an initial angle and an initial speed.  Air resistance is ignored in this example.","After launch, the person flies through the air, and his key properties are shown, including the <i>x</i>- and <i>y</i>-velocity components. The <i>x</i>-velocity is constant as he flies through the air. With our initial angle and speed, it is <span class=\"math\">35.5 m/s</span>.  It stays the same until he crashes back to Earth.","The <i>y</i>-velocity component changes as the projectile moves.  For instance, it is positive when the person is first launched, since he is moving up.  After he reaches the peak, the <i>y</i>-velocity becomes increasingly negative, and is equal but opposite to its initial value when he lands."],"objNames":["actwb_cannon"]}
