Why? The velocity is constant, so the acceleration, which is the rate of change of the velocity, is zero.","If the graph or parts of a graph are <b>not<\/b> a line, then there is acceleration, since the velocity is changing.  One example is the point when the velocity changes as the ride pauses at the top. We emphasize this point with an arrow.  The velocity changes so there is acceleration.","Other examples of acceleration occur at any curved parts of the graph. We highlight one example with an arrow.  At this part of the ride, the velocity is changing as gravity and the force exerted by the ride determine its velocity change.
