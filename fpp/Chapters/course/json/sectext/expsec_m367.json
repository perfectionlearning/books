    "As the puck moves, we show the acceleration using a green vector. ",
    "At equilibrium, the puck is not accelerating.  Why?  There is no force. The spring is not stretched or compressed.",
    "Once the puck moves beyond equilibrium, it starts to accelerate, because the spring is being stretched or compressed. The green arrow lengthens to reflect the greater acceleration. ",
    "At the extremes, the force—as well as the acceleration—is the greatest. Why?  The force is greatest there because the spring is the most stretched, or compressed, at these points.  As <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_hooke_equation'>Hooke’s law</a> states, the force is proportional to the displacement, which is greatest at these endpoints."
