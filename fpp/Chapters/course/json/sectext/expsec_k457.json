The relationship of molecules to each other within the matter defines the state. For instance, in a gas, molecules have no fixed relationship, but just collide like balls on a pool table.  With a solid, molecules are locked into a far more rigid relationship.","To discuss specific types of matter, we start with solids. We use an iron paper clip as an example of a solid. A paper clip is made up of about a billion trillion iron atoms, bonded together tightly in a repeating, crystal-like structure.  We show a representation of such a structure in the diagram.","Heat transferring to the paper clip causes the iron molecules to vibrate more, which can be measured as an increased temperature.  Typically, metals expand slightly when their temperature increases. ","Increasing the paper clip\u2019s temperature to more than <span class=\"ft\">1500\u00b0C causes the iron atoms to begin moving apart so much that the bonds between them start to break<\/span>. When the bonds between the atoms in a solid break, the solid melts into a liquid."],"objNames":["wb_solids_concept1"]}
