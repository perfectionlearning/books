","A number should not be written with more precision than can be measured or calculated.  ","For instance, if a student says something measures 5.333333333333 inches based on a ruler measurement, they are stating the measurement with more precision than the ruler can measure.  The “3’s” are more digits than can actually be measured.","But no one using a ruler like the one shown in the diagram can say whether the length might be 5.332 or 5.333 or 5.334 inches. ","A ruler might be judged to be able to measure a length as 5.3 inches, or 5.32 inches.  "],"objNames":["wb_math_significant_figures_purpose"]}
