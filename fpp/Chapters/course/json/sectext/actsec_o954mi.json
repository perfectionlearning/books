You use the arrow keys to navigate. They control the velocity components, in essence enabling you to go forward and back, and left and right. For example, if you press the up arrow key a few times, you will move forward rapidly. Press the left arrow key and you add a negative <i>x</i>-velocity component, which moves you left. If you press the space bar, the proton slows down. You can only get so close, and then you are prevented from getting any closer. ","You look through the front windshield of your vehicle to see the proton.  If you circle around the proton, you may also see the proton in your rearview mirror.  Who knew spaceships had rearview mirrors?   The arrow in the position gauge tells you both the location of your craft, and the direction you are facing, in case you ever feel lost. ","At first, just drive toward and away from the proton, using the up and down arrow keys. The force is in newtons, and the distance is in femtometers, which are <span class=\"st\">quadrillionths of a meter</span>. ","Record the force at various distances and graph the results.  Do you get a line, or do you get a curve?  Compare the results with Coulomb’s law."],"objNames":["unityact_echarge"]}
