","To explain the criterion, we again use the diffraction patterns created by two light sources.  Below each diffraction pattern is a graph of its intensity. We use two colors for these graphs so you can distinguish them.","In the upper diagram, we show objects that are about as close together as possible while remaining resolvable \u2212 they can still be perceived as separate objects. You see that the first dark band of the blue curve is located at the central band of the red curve, and vice versa. Rayleigh\u2019s criterion says this is the minimum separation required for the two objects to be resolved as separate objects.","The minimum angle between two light sources that an instrument can resolve as separate objects is about 1.22 times the wavelength, divided by the diameter of the aperture (the opening).  The aperture might be the pupil in a human eye, or a camera lens. For light passing through a circular aperture, the equation gives, not coincidentally, the angle from the centerline to the first dark circular band.
