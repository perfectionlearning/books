Here, the charged particle you see is creating an electric field, represented by the symbol <i>E<\/i>. ","Locate your mouse pointer anywhere on the screen. When you click, you will see an electric field vector that points in the direction of the field, and a readout that tells you the strength of the electric field at that point.","The initial charge of the visible particle is 1.00 nC, but you can use the controller in the simulation to change this to other values, both positive and negative.","How does the field strength vary with the distance from a certain charge? Does it seem to increase linearly as you move closer, or do you see great increases in the field at points near the charge?  You should see similarities between the electric field and the force that would be exerted on a positive charge.","Finally, change the charge in the simulation to a negative charge. How does the field change?  What stays the same?"],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_24_0"]}
