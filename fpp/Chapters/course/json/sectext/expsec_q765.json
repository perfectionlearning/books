It can be used to determine sign of charge carriers."}],"secText":["For many years, no one knew whether the movement of positive or negative particles made up typical electric currents.","Edwin Hall determined that a typical current consists of moving negative particles, now known to be electrons. ","The basic setup of Hallâ€™s experiment is shown here. You see a strip of gold with a current flowing through it in a magnetic field. The direction of the current is from left to right. The magnetic field points into the screen, so the current and the field are perpendicular. ","Hall knew the magnetic field would apply a force on the moving charges, forcing them to the top or bottom of the strip. We analyze what happens if the current carriers are positive. Their velocities will be in the direction indicated by the current arrow (that is, to the right). As you can confirm with the right-hand rule, the force on a positive particle is directed up. This causes the top of the strip to be positively charged and the bottom to be negatively charged.","For negative charge carriers, their velocity is in the direction opposite to the conventional current. Using the right-hand rule applied to negative charges, you see that the force on a negative charge carrier also points upward. If moving negative charges cause current, the top of the strip will be negatively charged and the bottom positively charged.  In the next section, we discuss the conclusion Hall drew from the experiment."],"objNames":["wb_hall_effect_concepts1"]}
