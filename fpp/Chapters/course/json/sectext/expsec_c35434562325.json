Elements in the first two columns contain alkali and alkali earth metals, with the exception of hydrogen, which is a nonmetallic gas.  You see these two columns (minus hydrogen) highlighted.","The elements in these two columns tend to be soft metals. Metals conduct electricity and heat. They can be stretched and formed.  Iron and nickel are other examples of metals.","The middle columns we show highlighted in the diagram contain ordinary metals such as iron and nickel. They tend to be hard metals. Examples include aluminum and tin. ","Most elements in the periodic table are metals. Except for mercury, they are solids at room temperature. Many are dull and they are hard. Metals conduct electricity and heat. They can be stretched and drawn. "],"objNames":["wb_periodictablephysicalproperties_2","wb_periodictablephysicalproperties_3"]}
