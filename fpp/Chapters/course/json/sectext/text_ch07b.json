For an explanation of how to incorporate Science Notebooks into your instruction, see Chapter 1 Overview, Part 1.","  <b>Group Activity: Exam Questions<\/b> Divide the class into four groups. Each group will be responsible for one lesson in the chapter. Ask each member of the group to independently write a question on his or her assigned lesson that could be used as an exam question for the class. Be sure they also write an answer. As a group, students then discuss which questions best suit the material. Also, they should decide on the best answer. Remind students to be respectful of each person\u2019s ideas. Next, have each group present a short summary of the lesson to the class. Finally, as a class, review the student-written questions and answers.","If your students have access to a file-sharing program, you may wish to have them submit the best questions and answers to the shared site so that the class can then use them as a study guide. Questions and answers can then be further improved as new information is learned."],"objNames":[]}
