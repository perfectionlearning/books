Black holes range in size from an atom to spheres that would hold millions of Earths. The black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy is called Sagittarius. It has a mass equal to about 4 million Suns and is as big as a few million Earths.\u00a0","The high concentration of mass produces a gravitational force so great that it prevents light from escaping \u2212 which is why they are called \u201cblack holes.\u201d  Though they cannot be directly seen, effects of their gravity can be detected on other bodies, such as the ripping apart of nearby stars.","Black holes can be formed as a massive, aged star burns out.  With no outward forces to prevent collapse, the force of gravity causes the star to collapse into a point of no volume called a \u201csingularity.\u201d","Black holes have many fascinating properties.  One is that information cannot escape from inside them, that is, events occurring within a certain boundary cannot affect events outside of that boundary. For that reason, that surface is called an \u201cevent horizon.\u201d ","Black holes were predicted by Einstein in his general theory of relativity, but one was not observed until 1971 (to be more precise, the effects of one were observed). Today, nations from across the globe launch space satellites to perform astronomy, including to search for black holes.  For instance, both the U.S.\/European Hubble observatory as well as the Japanese satellite ASTRO-H, have researched black holes. The international consensus of scientists confirms the mind-boggling reality of black holes."],"objNames":["wb_black_hole_concepts"]}
