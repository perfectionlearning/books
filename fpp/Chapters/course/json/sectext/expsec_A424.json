Black holes range in size from an atom to spheres that would hold millions of Earths. The black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy is called Sagittarius. It has a mass equal to about 4 million Suns and is as big as a few million Earths. ","The high concentration of mass produces a gravitational force so great that it prevents light from escaping − which is why they are called “black holes.”  Though they cannot be directly seen, effects of their gravity can be detected on other bodies, such as the ripping apart of nearby stars.","Black holes can be formed as a massive, aged star burns out.  With no outward forces to prevent collapse, the force of gravity causes the star to collapse into a point of no volume called a “singularity.”","Black holes have many fascinating properties.  One is that information cannot escape from inside them, that is, events occurring within a certain boundary cannot affect events outside of that boundary. For that reason, that surface is called an “event horizon.” "],"objNames":["wb_black_hole_concepts"]}
