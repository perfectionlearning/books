Here, we take this analysis and turn it into an equation that can be used to find the frequency of any harmonic. ","The wavelength of the <i>n<\/i>th harmonic is twice the string length divided by <i>n<\/i>. The frequency of the <i>n<\/i>th harmonic is <i>n<\/i> times the wave speed divided by twice the string length.","When both ends are fixed, every integer multiple of the fundamental frequency is a possible harmonic. This differs from harmonics when one end is fixed but the other end is free to move. We will discuss that case later."],"objNames":["wb_harmonics_equation"]}
