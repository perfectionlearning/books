Scientific notation is used to express the very large and small numbers used in the sciences.","An expression like 10<sup class=\"\">5<\/sup> is called a power. In the expression <span class=\"math\">10<sup>5<\/sup>,<\/span> the number 5 is superscripted \u2212 it is positioned higher than the 10. The 5 is the exponent.
