    "A car’s speed can be constant while its velocity changes.  How can that happen?  We show how with an example. The car travels at a constant speed.  But its changing direction means the velocity’s <span class=\"math\"><i>x-</i></span> and <span class=\"math\"><i>y</i></span>-components change.",
    "The changing values on the <i>x-</i> and <i>y</i>-component velocity gauges show the change.  However, as you can see, the speed is constant as the car moves around the circle. This type of motion is called <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_UCM_concept'>uniform circular motion</a>.  It is a later topic, but it is a good way to contrast speed and velocity.",
    "  <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='actwb_acceleration_definition'>Acceleration</a> is the rate of change of velocity. This is an example of acceleration due to a change in direction. We discuss this more later, but it is important to note that a vector’s magnitude can stay the same while its direction changes. "
