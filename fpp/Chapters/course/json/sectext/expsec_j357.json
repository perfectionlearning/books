","Density is the ratio of the mass of an object to its volume.  A material like lead has relatively high density, much greater than that of balsa wood.  Density is a property of a material and is independent of the size of an object. For example, the density of water in a swimming pool is the same as the density of water in a teacup. In contrast, the mass and weight of an object depend not only on the type of matter, but on how much matter is present.","Density is represented by the Greek letter <i>ρ</i>, pronounced “rho,” and is measured in kilograms per cubic meter."],"objNames":["wb_density_concepts","wb_density_equation"]}
