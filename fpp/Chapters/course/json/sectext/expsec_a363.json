","We want to convert grams to kilograms.  A “kilo” equals 1,000 of a unit.  ","To be sure about the numerator of the conversion factor, we write the first term as a fraction.  We put kilograms in the numerator and grams in the denominator of the conversion factor.","We do the multiplication. The unit gram cancels, since it is in the numerator of one fraction and the denominator of the other.  22,000 divided by 1,000 equals 22. ","We point out that a conversion factor equals 1. For example, 1,000 grams equals one kilogram, so that fraction equals 1.  Multiplying by a conversion factor does not change the amount of a quantity, but just the unit in which the amount is expressed."],"objNames":["wb_math_unitPrefixes3"]}
