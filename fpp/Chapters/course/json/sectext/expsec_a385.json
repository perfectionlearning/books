The rules in this section reflect that principle. ","The result of multiplying or dividing is a number with at most the same <b>number<\/b> of significant digits as the original number that has the fewest number of significant digits.  For instance, the product of 18 and 1.41 is 25, not 25.38, since 18 only has two significant digits. In our division example, one of the numbers has 3 significant digits, so the quotient must also have 3 significant digits.","If you are curious why we say the result has <b>no more<\/b> significant digits than the starting numbers: it is because the result can have fewer digits. Consider dividing 48 by 12.  The result is 4, which has 1, not 2, significant digits. ","Calculators report lots of digits \u2212 they do not \u201crespect\u201d significant digits.  So if you divide 20 by 7, you will see a number like the one displayed in the calculator.  Considering significant digits, 20 divided by 7 equals 3.
