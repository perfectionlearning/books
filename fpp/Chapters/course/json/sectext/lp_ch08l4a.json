Newton hypothesized that if a [OBJ:expsec_h570:cannonball] were fired fast enough from a cannon, the cannonball would remain in circular orbit around the Earth.<br />2. Examples of [OBJ:expsec_h570:circular orbits] include satellites rotating around planets, and planets rotating around the Sun.<br />3. The [OBJ:expsec_h572:speed of an object in circular orbit] can be calculated by taking the square root of the gravitational constant multiplied by the mass of the body being orbited, divided by the radius of the orbit.<br />4. The speed at which an object can [OBJ:expsec_h575:escape] a planet's gravity can be calculated by taking the square root of two times the gravitational constant, times the planet's mass, divided by the radius.","  <b>Vocabulary:</b>  [OBJ:expsec_h570:Newton's cannon], [OBJ:expsec_h570:satellite], [OBJ:expsec_h570:orbit], [OBJ:expsec_h575:escape speed]","  <b>STEM Skills:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1.
