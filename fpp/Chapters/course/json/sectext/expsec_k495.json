So as fall approaches and the cool air chills the lake, the top layer of water gets colder, contracts, and sinks. You may have experienced this effect if you have jumped into a lake. The water is colder the deeper you go. This chilling and sinking of the top layer continues until the lake is 4°C throughout.","Unlike other fluids, water <b>expands</b> instead of contracting as it cools from 4°C to 0°C. So, once the lake reaches 4°C, the top layer continues to cool but does not sink. Now the top layer is less dense, so it floats atop the warmer and denser water beneath. ","At 0°C, water turns to ice. Ice is also less dense than the 4°C water beneath, so it floats. This creates an ice layer on top of the water, insulating the water below. This phenomenon is crucial for aquatic life. It means the water under the ice in most ponds and lakes stays liquid. If water always contracted with cooler temperatures, lakes would freeze from the bottom up, and would be much more likely to become completely solid. "],"objNames":["wb_water_expansion_concepts"]}
