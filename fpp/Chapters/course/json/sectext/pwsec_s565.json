    "In this section, we explain how a simple antenna works.",
    "The starting point for our discussion is a <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_e_generator_concepts1'>generator</a>. It is used to create a potential difference that changes over time. ",
    "The generator produces an alternating current (AC).  An AC generator produces currents that change periodically in both direction and strength, like a sine wave. The generator is connected to two conducting rods that point in opposite directions. ",
    "The generator causes the rods to be charged. In one part of the cycle, the generator drives negative charges to the top and positive charges to the bottom. In a later part of the cycle, the charges on the antenna are reversed. The strength and orientation of the charge change constantly over time.",
    "Charged objects create electric fields. The changing charge causes the electric field strength and direction to change. ",
    "The changing electric field induces a changing magnetic field.  In the diagram, we show only the electric field for simplicityâ€™s sake.",
    "The combination of changing electric and magnetic fields forms an electromagnetic wave and radiation such as a <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_radio_speed2'>radio signal</a>.  By varying the frequency or amplitude of the generator, a signal can be sent. "
