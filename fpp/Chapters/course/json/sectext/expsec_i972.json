","By using calculus, equations for the moments of inertia of objects with common shapes can be determined. We start with three solid shapes, all rotated through the middle, about a symmetry axis.  In these equations, the letter <i>M</i> represents the mass of the object, <i>R</i> represents the radius, and <i>L</i> the length. ","In the lower diagram, we show the moments of inertia for a cylinder and sphere when they are hollow and the axis passes through the middle, or for a hollow sphere when the rotation axis is tangent to its surface. ","The equations reflect the concept that mass farther from the axis of rotation creates more rotational inertia.  For instance, the moment of inertia of the thin-walled cylinder is greater than that of a solid cylinder of equal mass, since its mass is farther from the axis."],"objNames":["wb_moments_cylinders1","wb_moments_cylinders2"]}
