","The rule is kind of a mouthful: The number of digits to the right of the decimal point is less than or equal to the number of digits to the right of the decimal point of every term in the sum or difference. ","It is more easily explained with examples.  Consider adding 1.234 and 78.9.","The smallest place value with significant digits is tenths: the .2 in 1.234 and the .9 in 78.9.  This means when you add them, you should write the result as 80.1.  You cannot write 80.134, which the calculator would tell you. 78.9 only goes to the nearest tenth, so the result cannot be more precise than to the tenth.","To put it another way: the operation cannot make measurements more precise than they were to begin with. Since 78.9 tells you the value only to the nearest tenth, adding to or subtracting from it cannot make the result more precise, like a number such as 80.13 would be."],"objNames":["wb_math_significant_figures_add_and_subtract"]}
