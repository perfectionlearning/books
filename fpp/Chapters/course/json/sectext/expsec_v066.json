With it, Einstein showed a fundamental relationship between mass and energy. An object\u2019s energy at rest equals its mass times the square of the speed of light. ","We supply context to the equation using the Sun. The Sun becomes less massive as its mass is transformed by fusion reactions into the energy it radiates. It radiates 3.91\u00d710<sup class=\"\">26<\/sup> joules per second, and as a consequence, it \u201closes\u201d more than four billion kilograms (4.0\u00d710<sup class=\"\">9<\/sup> kg) per second! (Don\u2019t worry! Its total mass is 1.99\u00d710<sup class=\"\">30<\/sup>\u00a0kilograms.)","Thermonuclear processes inside the Sun convert mass into a stupendous quantity of energy every second. Much more common amounts of matter yield tremendous amounts of energy as well. For example, if one gram of matter is converted entirely to energy, it produces the energy equivalent of burning fifteen thousand barrels of oil. ","To compare amounts of energy in another fashion, one gram from a popular chocolate covered peanut supplies about 5 kilocalories of energy if you eat it.","If your stomach were a nuclear reactor and converted that amount of mass to energy, it would produce about 2.15\u00d710<sup class=\"\">1<\/sup><sup class=\"\">0<\/sup> kilocalories, or about 4 billion times more energy.","On the dark side of things, converting into energy a tiny fraction of the matter in a nuclear bomb can produce a blast equivalent to the chemical energy released from the explosion of 50 billion kilograms of dynamite."],"objNames":["wb_emc2"]}
