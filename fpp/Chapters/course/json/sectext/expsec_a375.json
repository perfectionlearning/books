The first number is the mass in kilograms converted per second, while the second number is the number of seconds in a minute.","The first step in multiplying numbers in scientific notation is to multiply the leading values. We multiply 4.5 and 6.0 to get 27. ","Next, add the exponents of the powers of 10. We are multiplying 10<sup class=\"\">9</sup> and 10<sup class=\"\">1</sup>. The sum of 9 and 1 is 10, so the result is 10<sup class=\"\">10</sup>. ","The leading value must be between 1 and 10. We change 27 to 2.7. This is equivalent to dividing 27 by 10.
