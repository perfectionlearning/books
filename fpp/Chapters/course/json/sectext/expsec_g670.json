By locating the dancer’s center of mass, you can apply the laws and principles you have learned in physics about projectile motion. ","If you look at the dancer's head, which is not her center of mass, it moves nearly horizontally. This creates an illusion that she floats through the air. She accomplishes this by moving her legs up as she approaches the peak, which shifts her body’s center of mass toward her head. This reduces the distance from the center of mass to the top of her head, and though her center of mass still moves upward along an arc, her head appears to move in a straight line. ","After she passes the peak, she moves her legs downward, increasing the distance between her head and the center of mass. This again allows her head to continue straight as her center of mass drops."],"objNames":["wb_center_and_motion1"]}
