The electric potential increases at a constant rate from Plate A to Plate B. Why? Because the force exerted by the field on any test charge is constant throughout the field, so the work, and the change in potential energy per unit distance parallel to the field, are the same everywhere in the uniform field. ","The equation states the relationship in one dimension between a potential difference, a uniform electric field, and a displacement. The potential difference equals the negative of the product of the field and the displacement. It is negative for displacements that point in the same direction as the field."],"objNames":["wb_uniform_field_potential1","wb_uniform_field_potential_eq"]}
