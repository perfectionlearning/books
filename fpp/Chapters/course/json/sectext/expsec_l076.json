As the definition states, entropy is a measure of the disorder of a system. ","The less order a system has, the more entropy it has.","A deck of cards supplies a good example of entropy.  A new deck of cards has order: Cards are arranged in suits, from ace to king. ","Shuffle the cards, and entropy increases.  A heart is next to a club, an eight is next to a queen \u2212 there is less order. ","Energy is always conserved. However, the form of that energy can make it more or less useful.  Engines provide a good example of how some energy can become less useful, due to increasing disorder.","For instance, as the gas inside an engine warms up, gas particles collide with the wall of the engine, increasing the random kinetic energy of the engine wall and its temperature.  In a car engine, with walls that are not perfect insulators, you would notice this as a warmer engine.","This energy does not contribute to the work the engine does, but just adds to the random motion of the particles that are part of the engine.
