    "In this section, we discuss some equations that can be used to calculate the rate of heat transfer. ",
    "We start by defining the rate of heat transfer.  It (unsurprisingly enough) is the amount of heat divided by elapsed time.  Heat is energy, and energy divided by elapsed time is power, so the unit is a watt.",
    "The second equation shows how the rate of heat transfer is a function of the material’s thermal conductivity (a property specific to a material), the area of the material, the material’s thickness, and the temperature difference between the faces of the material.  ",
    "The third equation uses the R-value, the thermal resistance, of an object.  This is a value often stated for insulation in building supply stores.  Higher R-values mean an object is a better insulator, more resistant to the transfer of heat. "
