For instance, it might be 7 percent, for “aluminum and cracked,” which was 2 bars divided by 30 bars, the total number.  ","We calculate the relative frequencies for all the cells in the table.  For instance, 2 divided by 30 is 7%, 4 divided by 30 is 13%, and so on. ","We show the totals for each row and column.  You can see that sum in the totals column and the sum in the totals row are both 100%. ","This table gives a percentage or fractional view of the data in place of the absolute number, like “5” for the number of bars that we used in the previous section.  We can draw conclusions such as: “Only 7% of the bars we tested were aluminum and cracked” or “63% of the bars we tested were steel and uncracked.” We are using marginal frequencies, calculated as percentages."],"objNames":["wb_two_way_relative_table_finish_it"]}
