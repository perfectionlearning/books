[OBJ:expsec_k472:Thermal equilibrium] occurs when there is no net heat flow between two objects that are in contact with each other.<br />2. [OBJ:expsec_k473:Heat] is the movement of thermal energy. Heat flows spontaneously from warmer objects to colder objects. Heat does not flow spontaneously from colder objects to warmer objects.<br />3. [OBJ:expsec_k474:Specific heat] is the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one kilogram of a material by one degree Celsius.<br />4. [OBJ:expsec_k476:Calorimetry] is the study of heat transfer. Calorimeters can be used to identify the specific heat of an unknown object.","  <b>Vocabulary:</b>  [OBJ:expsec_k472:thermal equilibrium], [OBJ:expsec_k473:heat], [OBJ:expsec_k474:specific heat], [OBJ:expsec_k476:calorimeter], [OBJ:expsec_k476:calorimetry]","  <b>STEM Skills:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1.
