","Angular displacement is the change in angular position. You see the mushroom on the pizza rotating from one position to another. Its angular displacement equals its final angular position minus its initial angular position.","The mushroom rotates from an angular position of <i><span class=\"Symbols\">\u03c0<\/span><\/i>\/2 radians counterclockwise to <i><span class=\"Symbols\">\u03c0<\/span><\/i> radians, so its angular displacement is <b>positive <\/b><i><span class=\"Symbols\">\u03c0<\/span><\/i>\/2 radians. If it rotated clockwise instead, its displacement would be <b>negative<\/b>. ","Angular displacement includes the total angle swept out during the rotation.

The displacement equals the difference between the final and initial angular positions. This parallels the equation for linear displacement, which is the difference between final and initial linear positions."],"objNames":["wb_angular_position_concept","wb_angular_displacement_equation"]}
