Period."}],"secText":["The speed of light is about 300 million meters per second. Quite speedy! Obviously, animations such as the ones used in this section slow light down by a huge factor, so that we can show its passage. ","In addition to being fast, the speed of light is absolutely constant. The train is moving toward the observer at a great velocity. The observer measures exactly the same speed of light as when the train is stationary: The train’s motion does <b>not</b> change the measured speed of light.  ","This is in contrast with, say, a person on the train throwing a ball at the observer.  In that case, the two velocities would be added, and the ball would be moving faster relative to the observer.  Again, the speed of light is constant and does not change due to the motion of its source or the observer. This idea is one of two key postulates in Einstein’s theory of special relativity.
