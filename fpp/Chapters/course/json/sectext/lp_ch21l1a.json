[OBJ:expsec_u255:Refraction] is the change in direction of a wave at the boundary between two materials. Refraction is caused by the change in the speed of the wave as it moves between materials.<br />2. The [OBJ:expsec_u256:index of refraction] is a measure of how much light slows as it enters a material. To calculate the index of refraction, divide the speed of light in a vacuum by the speed of light in the material.<br />3. [OBJ:expsec_u258:Snell's law] relates the angle of incidence and angle of refraction to the refraction indices of the materials. The ratio of the sine of the incident angle to the sine of the refraction angle is equal to the ratio of the refraction index of the refracted material by the refraction index of the incident material.","  <b>Vocabulary:</b>  [OBJ:expsec_u255:refraction], [OBJ:expsec_u256:index of refraction], [OBJ:expsec_u258:Snell's law]","  <b>STEM Skills:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1.
