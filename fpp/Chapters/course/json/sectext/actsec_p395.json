{"cards":[{"lines":[{"type":"title","text":"Build your own electric circuit"}]}],"definitions":[],"secText":["In this section, you have a simulation in which you can build your own electric circuits. The simulation includes five light bulbs, each with a resistance of 50 ohms. You add and remove light bulbs and wires by dragging them. Only one light bulb can be placed on each wire segment.","In the simulation, you can use an ammeter (which measures current) and a voltmeter (which measures potential difference) to answer the questions that follow. How does the potential difference across the battery compare with the potential difference across the light bulb? What about the current? Is it the same everywhere, or does it differ from place to place?","Now add another light bulb above the first one in the circuit: Snap in two wire segments in a vertical orientation, and then put a segment containing a light bulb between them. See where the potential differences are the same in the circuit, and see where they differ.  Do the same for the current.","You can also use the voltmeter to confirm Ohmâ€™s law. You are told the resistance of the bulbs, and can measure the potential difference and current. "],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_29_0"]}
