An alpha particle is the same as a helium-4 nucleus. It consists of two protons and two neutrons. ","Two protons have left the nucleus, so its atomic number has decreased by two. The nucleus transmuted from uranium, with 92 protons, to thorium, which has only 90. The alpha particle took away four nucleons, so the mass number decreases by four. Uranium-238 becomes thorium-234."],"objNames":["wb_radioactive_3"]}
