Alternating current (AC) is another common form of current flow in circuits. We explain the two types of circuits. ","In a direct current circuit, electricity steadily flows in one direction.  We show this with arrows.  The amount of current may vary in different parts of the circuit, but it flows without changing direction.  Many circuits with batteries are direct current circuits.  ","In alternating current (AC) circuits, the direction and amount of the current changes regularly. This is caused by the changing voltage (emf) supplied by the AC generator.","Often, a <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_e_generator_concepts1'>generator<\/a> powers the circuit.  Both the direction and the amount of current change periodically. The current out of an electrical outlet in your house or school is AC."],"objNames":["wb_DC_circuits","wb_AC_circuits"]}
