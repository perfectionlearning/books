The ratio of charge to potential difference is the capacitance.","The opposite charges create an electric field, <b>E<\/b>, between the plates.  It is directed as shown in the diagram.  Although we do not discuss this topic in depth in this textbook, electric potential energy resides in electric fields. The potential energy stored by the capacitor can be calculated from this electric field.","We show the equation for the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor in terms of the area of its plates and the distance between them. Large plates that are closer together have greater capacitance. "],"objNames":["wb_energy_capacitor_concepts2","wb_energy_capacitor_concepts3"]}
