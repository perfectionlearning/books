The [OBJ:expsec_o968:electric force] is the attraction or repulsion between charged particles. Like charges repel, while opposite charges attract. <br />2. [OBJ:expsec_o969:Coulomb's law] calculates the force between two charged particles. To find the electric force, multiply Coulomb's constant by the charge of particle 1 by the charge of particle 2 divided by the square of the distance between the charged particles.","  <b>Vocabulary:</b>  [OBJ:expsec_o968:electric force], [OBJ:expsec_o969:Coulomb’s law]","  <b>STEM Skills:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1.
