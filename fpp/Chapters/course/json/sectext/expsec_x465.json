","We show the first four energy levels of a hydrogen atom. They correspond to the <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_bohr1'>orbits</a> you just saw. These are the lowest four discrete energy levels that the electron in a hydrogen atom can have. ","You may note that these values are negative. Physicists think of a hydrogen electron as being like a rock at the bottom of a well. It takes energy for this rock to escape from the well, and the closer it is to the bottom of the well, the more negative its energy is. Similarly, a hydrogen atom with its electron orbiting close to the nucleus has less energy than when the electron is farther away. ","We show the equation for calculating the change of energy as an electron moves from one orbit to another. As usual, it equals the difference between the final and initial energies.  For instance, if an atom absorbs a photon, the energy change will be positive as the electron moves to a larger orbit and the atom absorbs the photon’s energy.
