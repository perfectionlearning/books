An antineutrino has almost zero mass and has no charge, so we do not show it.","When the nucleus emits a negatively charged electron, the conservation of charge law says the nuclear charge must increase by one elementary charge. In other words, the number of protons increases by one. In this example, the isotope of hydrogen has one proton, and the stable helium isotope has two. Transmutation has occurred. ","Note that for beta decay, the mass of the nucleus stays essentially the same. The new proton is created from a neutron in the nucleus. Since the beta particle has very, very little mass compared to a nucleon, the mass of the nucleus is relatively unchanged. You see in the diagram that only the number of protons is different in the daughter nucleus, not the mass number."],"objNames":["wb_radiation_4"]}
