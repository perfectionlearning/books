","In the first experiment shown, light is shined at a ball, forming a shadow on the screen behind it. Surprisingly, there is a bright spot at the center of the shadow. The diffraction of light around the edge of the ball accounts for this spot, called the Poisson spot.","In the second illustration, we show straight edge diffraction. When light passes a well-defined edge it diffracts around it. The result is the interference pattern we show.  Instead of a clearly defined shadow created by an object, you see a pattern of light and dark bands. "],"objNames":["wb_poisson_spot_concepts","wb_straight_edge_concepts2"]}
