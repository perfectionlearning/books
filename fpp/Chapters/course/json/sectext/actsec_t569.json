You can turn on ray tracing with the SHOW RAYS button, and see how the rays can be used to determine the location of the image.","Some questions to consider include: Is the image ever inverted? Is it ever larger than the object? Is it ever real? Is it ever farther from the mirror than the object is? The object can be moved to positions that allow you to answer all of these questions."],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_35_15"]}
