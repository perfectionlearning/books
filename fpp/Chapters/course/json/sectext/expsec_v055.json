They knew that the positive charge carried almost all the mass of the atom, since electrons have so little mass. The analogy of that time was the plum pudding model: An atom was thought to have negatively charged electrons (plums) scattered throughout a massive pudding of positive charge.","Through a series of experiments, scientists proved this model to be wrong in the early 20<sup class=\"\">th<\/sup> century. The positive charge of an atom is not scattered throughout the atom but is very tightly packed in a nucleus. "],"objNames":["wb_rutherford_concepts1"]}
