Both are inverse-square forces:  The amount of force scales as the reciprocal of the square of the distance from the source of force.  The surface of a sphere will be points that experience forces of equal magnitude.  For instance, a gravitational force of 100 newtons between the Sun and a 10-kilogram mass is found when the 10-kg mass is at any point about 3.6 billion meters from the center of the Sun. We calculated this by solving Newton’s law of gravitation for the distance, as we show. The direction of the gravitational force will change — it will always point toward the other mass — but the amount of force will be constant.","Both Newton’s and Coulomb’s laws are inverse square laws. If we solve Coulomb’s law for the distance, the equation shows that the distance between two given charges that experience a given force will always be the same.  The direction of the force will be the same (toward one another if the charges are opposite, away from each other if they are the same) but the amount is the same at a given distance.","A final way to consider why a sphere defines surfaces of a constant force is to consider the equation for the field strength. We will do that for the electric field.  Its strength is the same for a given source charge at a given distance − so the field strength is constant for points that lie on the surface of a sphere. This means that the amount of force the field exerts on a given test charge will be constant on a spherical surface.  "],"objNames":["wb_spheres_and_force2","wb_spheres_and_force3"]}
