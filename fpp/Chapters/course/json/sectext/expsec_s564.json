The pressure is great enough to propel spacecraft that have special solar sails.","When an electromagnetic wave is absorbed or reflected by a surface, momentum is transferred from the wave to the surface.","This <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_impulse'>momentum transfer<\/a> means the radiation applies a force, like a ball striking a block.  The force divided by the area is the pressure.  The force is greater if the wave is reflected, just like a ball bouncing off a surface applies more force than the same ball sticking to a surface.","If light is thought of as a particle, then the collisions can be thought of like any object striking a stationary object.  If the light is absorbed, it is an inelastic collision.  If it is reflected, then the collision is elastic, and twice as much momentum is transferred.  This is why spaceships that take advantage of radiation pressure have reflective surfaces."],"objNames":["wb_radiation_pressure_concepts1","wb_radiation_pressure_concepts2"]}
