When drag equals weight, there is no net force, and the object stops accelerating.    ","In this situation, the object has reached terminal velocity.  Research has shown, for example, that cats reach terminal velocity after falling about 6 stories (please do not repeat the experiment!).  In fact, they slow down a bit after 6 stories.","Why?  First they reach terminal velocity. Then they even relax a bit (don’t try that!), which increases their cross-sectional area, increases air resistance, and slows them down.
