In other words, photons are injected into the medium. We show one about to pass near a neon atom whose electron is at energy level <i>E</i><sub class=\"\">B</sub>. ","The incoming photon causes the neon atom to emit an additional photon with the same frequency as the incoming photon. The neon atom  simultaneously drops to energy level <i>E</i><sub class=\"\">C</sub>. This is the essential element of the light amplification process. Energy supplied to helium atoms is transferred to neon atoms, and then unleashed as coherent photons. ","The neon atom is still excited, since it still has an electron at the energy level <i>E</i><sub class=\"\">C</sub>. It will rapidly and spontaneously emit other photons and return to <i>E</i><sub class=\"\">0</sub>. These other photons have a different energy and frequency than the stimulated radiation photons.  They are emitted in random directions, and are noise in the laser signal. ","When the neon atom returns to <i>E</i><sub class=\"\">0</sub>, it cannot absorb any of the photons being shined into the medium, since these photons are given energies equal to the difference between <i>E</i><sub class=\"\">C</sub> and <i>E</i><sub class=\"\">B</sub>. In other words, the photons do not have enough energy to propel a neon atom all the way from <i>E</i><sub class=\"\">0</sub> to <i>E</i><sub class=\"\">B</sub>. This is important, because a laser needs the photons to stimulate emissions, not to be absorbed by atoms. Now the neon atoms are back in their original state, ready to be re-excited by helium atom collisions to <i>E</i><sub class=\"\">B</sub>. "],"objNames":["wb_laser4"]}
