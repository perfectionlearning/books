","You see a fluid flowing through a closed system. The fluid’s pressure, speed, and height change as it flows. Bernoulli’s principle states that a sum involving these quantities is constant in the entire system. ","The first term in Bernoulli’s principle is pressure. We show this with pressure gauges.","The second term is kinetic energy per unit volume.  It is related to the fluid density and flow velocity.","The third term is the potential energy per unit volume.  If the height changes, then pressure or velocity must change.","The sum of pressure, <i>PE</i> per unit volume, and <i>KE</i> per unit volume, is constant in a closed system.","One example of the principle at work: if a fluid flows downhill, either its pressure or speed must increase, since the <i>PE</i> per unit volume has been reduced.","Bernoulli’s principle can be expressed as an equation. We write the equation using density in the place of mass in the expressions for kinetic and potential energy.  It is the density of energy of the fluid at a given point that is the relevant factor.
