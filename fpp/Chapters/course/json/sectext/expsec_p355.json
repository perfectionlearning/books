It is in the opposite direction of typical currents, which consist of electron flow."}],"secText":["Conventional current is the direction of current used in diagrams and to analyze circuits. It assumes the moving charge is positive. Typical currents found in conventional circuits consist of electron flow, so conventional current points in the direction opposite to that in which electrons flow.  ","Early scientists did not know whether negative charge or positive charge flowed through wires. They established the convention, or habit, that the flow of <b>positive charge<\/b> makes up a current, and that convention remains in use today. ","Instead of electrons moving, we show the \u201csame\u201d current, represented as though the current were made of positive charge. Instead of negative charge moving to the left, we show positive charge moving to the right. The current arrow points in the direction that the positive charge is flowing.
