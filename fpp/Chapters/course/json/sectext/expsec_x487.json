It is an implication of quantum theory. You are accustomed to the limitations in the accuracy of measurements you make, that are typically rooted in the limits of the equipment.  For example, an electronic stopwatch might only show the results to the nearest hundredth of a second. ","In contrast, Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is an absolute theoretical limit. The principle says that observations can only be so precise, no matter how good the equipment used to make the observation.  ","Heisenberg summed it up in a paper he wrote in 1927: “The more precisely the position is determined, the less precisely the momentum is known in this instant and vice versa.” A more precise measurement of position comes at the “cost” of less precision concerning momentum. In sum, there will always be some uncertainty if we try to fix both the position and momentum of a particle.  ","The equation sums it up: the product of the uncertainty in position and the uncertainty in momentum along the same direction must be greater than one-half of Planck’s constant. The equation quantifies what we have said:  the more we know about a particle’s position, the less we know about its associated momentum. A particle’s position and momentum must contain a certain minimum amount of uncertainty, because the wave-particle is spread out in space.  ","As with much of quantum physics, the difference between classical and quantum physics becomes apparent only when the particle is very small.  One way to “see” this is to consider how very, very small Planck’s constant is, on the order of 10<sup class=\"\">−34</sup> joule second.  Objects with, say, the momentum of a car would have a very, very, very small, virtually undiscernible amount of uncertainty in their position."],"objNames":["wb_heisenberg","wb_heisenberg2"]}
