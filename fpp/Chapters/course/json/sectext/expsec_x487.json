It is an implication of quantum theory. You are accustomed to the limitations in the accuracy of measurements you make, that are typically rooted in the limits of the equipment.  For example, an electronic stopwatch might only show the results to the nearest hundredth of a second. ","In contrast, Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty principle is an absolute theoretical limit. Observations can only be so precise, no matter how good the equipment used to make the observation.  ","Heisenberg summed it up in a paper he wrote in 1927: \u201cThe more precisely the position is determined, the less precisely the momentum is known in this instant and vice versa.\u201d A more precise measurement of position comes at the \u201ccost\u201d of less precision concerning momentum. In sum, there will always be some uncertainty if we try to fix both the position and momentum of a particle.  ","The equation sums it up: the product of the uncertainty in position and the uncertainty in momentum along the same direction must be greater than one-half of Planck\u2019s constant. The equation quantifies what we have said:  the more we know about a particle\u2019s position, the less we know about its associated momentum. A particle\u2019s position and momentum must contain a certain minimum amount of uncertainty, because the wave-particle is spread out in space.  ","As with much of quantum physics, the difference between classical and quantum physics becomes apparent only when the particle is very small.  One way to \u201csee\u201d this is to consider how very, very small Planck\u2019s constant is, on the order of 10<sup class=\"\">\u221234<\/sup> joule second.  Objects with, say, the momentum of a car would have a very, very, very small, virtually undiscernible amount of uncertainty in their position."],"objNames":["wb_heisenberg","wb_heisenberg2"]}
