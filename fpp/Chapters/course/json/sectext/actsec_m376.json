","Use the activity to begin your exploration of waves. The control panel allows you to control the amplitude and frequency. ","Try three quick experiments. First, does changing the frequency of a wave also change its wavelength, the distance between adjacent wave peaks? ","Second, does changing the frequency result in any change in amplitude? ","Finally, if you change the frequency, does the wave travel down the string any faster or slower?  Does changing the amplitude have any impact on the speed? "],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_16_0"]}
