Let\u2019s contrast them. ","Conduction occurs when thermal energy locally transfers from particle to particle.  It is the passing of thermal energy between nearby particles within a substance, without overall motion of the medium. Generally, conduction occurs only in solids.","Convection is the thermal transfer of energy by the circulation, or movement, of warmer (more energetic) fluid matter. The energy is exchanged by the flow of the warmer matter, and the cooler matter that moves to replace it.","Radiation is the transfer of energy through space by electromagnetic radiation. ","In sum, both conduction and convection involve matter, but conduction is the transfer of thermal energy by local collisions within matter, while convection involves the bulk movement of matter.  Radiation is heat transfer not via matter or collisions within matter, but by electromagnetic radiation."],"objNames":["wb_contrast_thermal_processes"]}
