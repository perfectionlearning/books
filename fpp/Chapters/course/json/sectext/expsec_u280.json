Snell\u2019s law, relating how the angle of incidence of a light ray determines the angle of refraction, can be used to explain how the surgery improves vision.  ","When a light ray passes into the eye, it refracts at both the cornea and the lens. The upper diagram shows how light refracts for a person with nearsightedness. Nearsightedness occurs when the image forms before the rays reach the retina. ","During laser eye surgery, a surgeon\u2019s laser reshapes the cornea to correct for nearsightedness, reducing its curvature. In the animation, you see laser eye surgery performed on a nearsighted eye. ","Flattening the cornea reduces the angle of incidence of light rays. This means the rays refract less than they did before the surgery. In the lower diagram, you can see the original shape of the eye as a dashed line. The path that light rays take after surgery is shown, and they properly form an image on the retina.  "],"objNames":["wb_laser_eye_concepts1","wb_laser_eye_concepts2"]}
