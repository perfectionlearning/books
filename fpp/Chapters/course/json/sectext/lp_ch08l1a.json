[OBJ:expsec_h556:Uniform circular motion] is motion along a circular path at a constant speed.<b><br /></b>2. The rotational [OBJ:expsec_5180:period] for the orbit of an object can be calculated by dividing 2Ï€r, by the constant speed that the object is moving.<b><br /></b>3. The [OBJ:expsec_h557:centripetal acceleration] of an object can be calculated by dividing the speed of an object moving in circular motion squared, by the radius of the circle.","  <b>Vocabulary:</b>  [OBJ:expsec_h556:uniform circular motion], [OBJ:expsec_5180:period], [OBJ:expsec_h557:centripetal acceleration]","  <b>STEM Skills:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1.
