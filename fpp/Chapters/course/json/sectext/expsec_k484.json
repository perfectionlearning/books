","When the cast iron pan is put on the stove, the bottom of the pan gets hot. Even though the handle of the pan is not over the burner, it too soon gets hot through a process called conduction. During conduction, heat flows within an object, between nearby molecules, or between objects in direct contact.","We explain conduction on a molecular level. In the second diagram, molecules in the warmer water are moving faster \u2212 have greater kinetic energy \u2212 than the molecules in the cooler thermometer.  ","The water molecules collide with molecules in the glass cover of the thermometer, exchanging energy.  ","The cooler object gains thermal energy as its molecules move faster, and the warmer object loses thermal energy.  This occurs within the thermometer too, as the liquid in the thermometer gains energy from the glass.","As time passes, the objects reach the same temperature and the result is thermal equilibrium.  No net heat flows at this point. "],"objNames":["wb_conduction_concepts1","wb_conduction_concepts2"]}
