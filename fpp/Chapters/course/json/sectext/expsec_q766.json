He analyzed the direction of the potential difference.","If the current carriers are positive, the top of the strip is positive, creating a higher potential at the top than at the bottom. If the current carriers are negative, the top of the strip is negative, creating a lower potential at the top compared to the bottom. Hall measured the potential difference across the strip.","Hall found that the potential was lower at the top than at the bottom. This means negative charges had gathered at the top of the strip, proving that it was moving negative charges that made up the current. We now know that these negative charges are electrons."],"objNames":["wb_hall_effect_concepts1a","wb_hall_effect_concepts2"]}
