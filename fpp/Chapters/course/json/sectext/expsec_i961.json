","The definitions for displacement, velocity, and acceleration are parallel.  For instance, the definition of linear velocity is linear displacement divided by elapsed time.  With angular velocity, it is the angular displacement divided by elapsed time.  Only the words “linear” and “angular” need to be changed, as well as changing the inputs to the equations.","The same applies for force, energy, and work equations.  We show those in the second table. For instance, replace force with torque, mass with moment of inertia, and linear acceleration with angular acceleration, and the equations are identical."],"objNames":["wb_table_angular_versus_linear_equations","wb_table_angular_versus_linear_equations2"]}
