Spherical mirrors do not create “perfect” images.","Rays coming in parallel to the principal axis of a spherical mirror do not reflect exactly through the focal point. This effect is called “spherical aberration.” The farther an incident ray is from the principal axis, the more the reflected ray will miss passing through the focal point.  The result is an image that is not perfectly focused − an image that can be a bit fuzzy."],"objNames":["wb_spherical_mirrors_abberration_concepts"]}
