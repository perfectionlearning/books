{"cards":[{"lines":[{"type":"title","text":"Radioactive dating"}]}],"definitions":[],"secText":["Carbon-14 is a radioactive isotope of carbon that has six protons and eight neutrons. It is commonly used to establish a date for organic specimens. In the first simulation, you will observe its decay and determine its half-life.","You are equipped with a digital timer and a gauge that reports the number of parent atoms that are present. Before the simulation starts, there are 32 billion parent atoms. Each of the spheres on the screen represents a billion atoms and it changes color when a billion atoms have decayed.","In the simulation, time is sped up and passes in thousands of years. When half the initial number of parent atoms have become daughter atoms, pause the simulation and note the elapsed time. ","Repeat this process a few times, pausing each time when the half the remaining parent atoms have decayed. Enter your measurement for the half-life of carbon-14 by selecting the appropriate amount of years. "],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_43_21_1"]}
