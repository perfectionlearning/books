But fields surround an electric charge. Diagrams are used to show the nature of the field at many locations.   ","In the upper illustration, you see two identical diagrams of the forces exerted on positive test charges by a single positive charge. Remember that the strength of a force vector is proportional to its length. ","We convert the force diagram into an electric field diagram. The arrows on the lines are used to indicate the direction of the field at any point. ","As you can see in the upper field diagram, the electric field lines are directed away from the central charge. This makes sense because a positive test charge at any location would experience a force pointing directly <b>away<\/b> from the positive charge. ","In contrast, electric field lines around a negative charge point <b>toward<\/b> the charge.  The lower diagram shows the electric field surrounding a negative point charge. The field is stronger in regions closer to the negative charge, which is represented in electric field diagrams by the lines being closer together. The field is stronger in the region of the lower pink box than it is in the upper box, because the lines are closer together in the lower box than they are in the upper."],"objNames":["wb_efield_diagrams_concepts","wb_efields_diagram_concepts2"]}
