As before, submarines lurk under the waves, but now you have only a single helicopter.","However, there is good news: Now you have more intellectual firepower because you have the aid of Snell’s law. You are also given some assistance from an able comrade. She has computed the angles of refraction required for your laser to reach the submarines. You should use 1.33 for the index of refraction of water, and 1.00 for the index of refraction of air."],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_36_10"]}
