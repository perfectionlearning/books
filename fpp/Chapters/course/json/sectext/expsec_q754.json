All magnets have two poles, called north and south, shown on these magnets by the capital letters \u201cN\u201d and \u201cS.\u201d","As is the case with electric charges, magnets apply forces on other magnets.  And as with electric charges, opposites attract. The illustration shows the forces pulling the magnets together, because the north pole of one magnet is attracted to the adjacent south pole of the other and vice versa.","The like poles of two magnets repel. When the magnets are placed so that their north poles are closest, or their south poles are closest, the magnets repel each other."],"objNames":["wb_magnet_fundamentals_concepts"]}
