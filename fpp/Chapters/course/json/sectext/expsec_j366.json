","The pressure of the air surrounding us is very large. This was demonstrated in Germany, in 1654, using two pairs of horses and a sphere. As shown in the illustration, almost all the air was removed from the volume enclosed by the two hollow hemispheres. ","There was almost no air pressure pushing out from the inside of the sphere, but atmospheric pressure pushed in on the outside of the vessel. The force of atmospheric pressure was so great that the halves could not be pulled apart by teams of horses. ","A quick estimate of the force required indicates it was over 100,000 newtons, or more than 10 tons, for each team of horses.  Whoa, Nellie!"],"objNames":["wb_air_pressure_concept"]}
