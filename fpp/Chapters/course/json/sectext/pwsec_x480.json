Here, we focus on the experience of an individual atom within the medium. ","When one of an atom\u2019s electrons is excited, it absorbs energy and moves to a higher energy level.  ","When the electron falls to a lower energy state, it releases a photon.  The photon\u2019s frequency depends on the change of energy levels.  The atom\u2019s electrons can only exist at certain energy levels, which means only certain changes in electron energy are possible. The spacing of energy levels dictates the possible frequencies of emitted photons.  "],"objNames":["wb_laser3"]}
