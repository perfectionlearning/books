This limits what the gauge can display − for instance, it cannot show 80.46, because it only shows tenths, not hundredths.","Computers − and most devices that use microprocessors − process digital information. Their systems are based on processing information that can be represented with strings of 1s and 0s. Computers can convert the digital information into forms we perceive as analog − such as music or voice − when necessary."],"objNames":["wb_digital","wb_digital2"]}
