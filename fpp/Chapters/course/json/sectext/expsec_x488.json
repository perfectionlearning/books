","In short, it says the more we know about a particle’s position, the less we know about its momentum. A particle’s position and momentum must reflect a certain minimum amount of uncertainty because the wave-particle is spread out in space.  ","As with much of quantum physics, the difference between classic and quantum physics becomes apparent only when the particle is very small.  One way to “see” this is to consider how very, very small Planck’s constant is, on the order of 10<sup class=\"\">−34</sup> joule second.  Objects with, say, the momentum of a car would have a very, very, very small amount of uncertainty in their position."],"objNames":["wb_heisenberg2"]}
