A physical model describes a part of the world as objects with relationships.  An example of a physical model is picturing a hydrogen atom as a negatively charged electron circling a positively charged nucleus.  ","Physical models helped scientists understand the size and charge of an electron and a nucleus, which was crucial to understanding the atom.  Using hypotheses and data, scientists concluded that over 99 percent of an atom is empty space.","A conceptual model presents an idea. Albert Einstein was famous for conceptual models.  For instance, he said that time was not absolute âˆ’ different observers could measure different amounts of time passing between the same two events.  ","A mathematical model uses equations to show relationships.  A simple mathematical model is that force equals the product of mass and acceleration.  ","The models in this textbook concern science, specifically physics. They are based on inferences drawn from observations, such support of the Standard Model due to the discovery of the Higgs boson.  One result of this work is theories, which are well supported explanations. ","Laws are well supported descriptions. They describe specific relationships under given conditions in nature, but do not offer explanations for those relationships.  Laws are distinct from theories; the two do not switch roles."],"objNames":["wb_models_data2","wb_models_data"]}
