","To calculate the net field created by multiple charges, you calculate the vector sum of the individual fields. We show this principle in the animation, starting with the charge <i>q<\/i><sub class=\"\">1<\/sub> and the field <i>E<\/i><sub class=\"\">1<\/sub> that it creates at a particular point.","Then we show the second charge <i>q<\/i><sub class=\"\">2<\/sub> and the field <i>E<\/i><sub class=\"\">2<\/sub> that it creates at the same point.","Finally, sum <i>E<\/i><sub class=\"\">1<\/sub> and <i>E<\/i><sub class=\"\">2<\/sub> to find the net field at the point. The net field vector <i>E<\/i><sub class=\"\">net<\/sub> at this location is directed straight up. Why? Because the <i>x<\/i>-components of the individual fields cancel out. The <i>y<\/i> components of the individual fields combine constructively, both of them pointing upward. We could compute the vector value of the combined electric field at any location in the same manner. "],"objNames":["wb_multiple_fields_concepts","wb_e_fields_multiple_concepts2"]}
