Protons, which are positively charged, are shown as red spheres. ","The number of protons in the nucleus is unique to each element. For instance, all atoms of carbon have 6 protons, and all gold atoms have 79 protons. ","We represent neutrons with gray spheres. A nucleus of every element but one has neutrons.  The exception: The most common form of hydrogen has no neutrons.  Together, protons and neutrons are called “nucleons,” as they make up the nucleus.  ","The table shows the mass and charge of each of the three particles that make up atoms. The masses of the proton and neutron are quite similar. ","Although they have the same magnitude of charge, protons are far more massive than electrons. A proton has a mass about 1,800 times that of the electron."],"objNames":["wb_nucleus_parts1","wb_table_nucleus_parts2"]}
