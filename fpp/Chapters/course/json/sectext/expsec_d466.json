Watch the gauges in the video as the car moves first along, or parallel to, the <i>x<\/i>-axis, then into a curve, and finally parallel to the <i>y<\/i>-axis. The gauge on the left displays the car\u2019s velocity in the <i>x<\/i>-direction; and the other gauge displays the car\u2019s velocity in the <i>y<\/i>-direction. In the curve, notice that the <i>x<\/i>-velocity <b>de<\/b>creases while the <i>y<\/i>-velocity <b>in<\/b>creases. ","Each gauge displays only the velocity in its direction.  For instance, <i>x<\/i>-velocity is along one line and <i>y<\/i>-velocity is along another, just like the <i>x<\/i><i>-<\/i> and <i>y<\/i>-axes on a graph.
