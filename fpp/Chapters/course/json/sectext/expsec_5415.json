To put it another way, the existence of these and other particles was confirmed by accelerators.  In many cases, theoretical physicists proposed that such particles should exist.  The SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in California played a key role in many of these discoveries. ","In the European accelerator run by the research group CERN, physicists have succeeded in assembling an antimatter hydrogen atom.  Antimatter is composed of antiparticles, which have the same mass as ordinary particles, but have opposite charge (and other properties that we have not discussed, such as lepton and baryon number).  For instance, a positron \u2212 an antielectron \u2212 has the same mass as an electron, but the opposite electric charge and lepton number. ","We mentioned the <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_standard_model5'>Higgs boson<\/a> earlier. A major focus of the CERN Large Hadron Collider system is to confirm the existence and properties of the Higgs boson, and currently scientists think they have very good evidence of this particle\u2019s existence.
