    "Diffraction alone can cause an interference pattern.  When diffraction occurs, a pattern of light and dark bands can result from a single slit.  In this section, we show how diffraction causes such a pattern, using Huygen’s principle to explain why.   ",
    "We start with a photograph of the interference pattern caused by single-slit diffraction. It shows a broad central bright band surrounded with less distinct dark and bright bands. This contrasts with a <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_double_slit_white_concepts2'>double-slit pattern</a>, which has a more consistent pattern of light and dark bands. ",
    "Although we will focus on discussing diffraction patterns caused by a single slit, diffraction causes other types of interference patterns as well. In the second illustration, we show straight-edge diffraction, diffraction caused by a well-defined edge. ",
    "The result of this type of diffraction is the interference pattern we show.  Instead of a clearly defined shadow created by the edge of an object, you see a pattern of light and dark bands.  This is caused by light diffracting around the object’s edge. "
