[OBJ:expsec_x482:Matter waves] defined particles as having wavelike properties.<br />2. Light interference patterns look similar to [OBJ:expsec_x484:electron interference patterns].<br />3. The [OBJ:expsec_x487:Heisenberg uncertainty principle] states that observations can only be so precise. Applying the theory to electrons and orbitals, the precise location of an electron in an orbital is a [OBJ:expsec_x486:probability], and not an exact determination of the location.<br />4. [OBJ:expsec_x489:Erwin Schr√∂dinger's] thought experiment paralleled the idea that the position of a particle can be predicted, but only once the position is observed does it become known.<br />5. To calculate the [OBJ:expsec_x483:wavelength of a matter wave], divide Planck's constant by momentum.","  <b>STEM Skills:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1.
