The accelerators typically use a beam of particles.","Radiofrequency cavities create electromagnetic fields to provide acceleration to a beam of particles. The cavities are located along the beam pipe. Each time a beam passes through the electromagnetic field in a cavity, some of the energy from the radio wave is transferred to the particles.","In accelerators, magnets are used to focus a beam, gathering all the particles closer together (similar to the way that lenses are used to focus a beam of light). In circular accelerators, magnets are also used to bend the path of a beam of particles that would otherwise travel in a straight line. The more energy a particle has, the greater the magnetic field needed to bend its path. ","Particle detectors record and visualize the showers of particles that result from the collisions.  The information obtained on a particleâ€™s speed, mass, lifetime, and electric charge helps physicists to work out the identity of the particle."],"objNames":["wb_particle_accelerator_3"]}
