Specific heat states how much heat is required to raise the temperature of one kilogram of a material by one degree Celsius or Kelvin. ","A material with a large specific heat requires more heat per kilogram to produce a given change in temperature than one with a smaller specific heat.","Materials have different specific heat constants. For instance, as the graph illustrates, it takes much more energy to increase the temperature of a kilogram of water by one Kelvin than it does a kilogram of lead. ","Water has a much higher specific heat than lead. It also has a higher specific heat than air − so bodies of water such as lakes or oceans will moderate temperature, staying more constant as the Earth’s atmosphere heats and cools.","The heat transferred to or from an object equals the product of a material’s specific heat constant <i>c</i>, the mass of the object, and the temperature change.
