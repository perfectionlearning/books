{"cards":[{"lines":[{"type":"title","text":"Electric field"}]}],"definitions":[],"secText":["In the simulation, you explore the relationship between force and a field that is created by two unequal charges: a charge of +90.0 nC and a charge of <span class=\"Symbols\">−</span>45.0 nC. Your task is to drag a positive test charge (+1.00 nC) into the field and observe the direction and magnitude of the force that the field exerts on it.","After experimenting with this simulation, consider the answers to three questions. First, is the force on the test charge greater where the field lines are closer together, or where they are farther apart? Second, what is the relationship between the direction of the force and the field lines? Third, what…is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow? (Just kidding…But Monty Python fans know the consequences of a wrong answer.)"],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_24_5_1"]}
