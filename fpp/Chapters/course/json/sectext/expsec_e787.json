We start by discussing how to add vectors that are both horizontal, or both vertical.  We show the vectors in green and blue, and their sum is below them.To add vectors graphically, you place the tail of the vector being added to the head of the vector it is being added to.  The simplest cases are when both vectors are either horizontal or vertical.","We start by adding two positive vectors. Both point to the right.  As the top illustration shows, a vector of 3 plus a vector of 2 equals a vector of 5. The resulting vector has a length that is the sum of the lengths of the vectors that are added.","Next, we add two negative vectors. Both point to the left so they are negative. A vector of −<span class=\"math\">4 </span>plus a vector of −<span class=\"math\">3</span> equals a vector of −<span class=\"math\">7</span>. The sum vector points to the left also.","As the third example in the top diagram, we add vectors with different signs. When we add <span class=\"math\">5 + (−1), </span>we get<span class=\"math\"> 4, </span>just as we would if we were summing on a number line.<span class=\"math\"></span>","We show in the second diagram that adding two vertical vectors is similar to adding two horizontal vectors. The illustration shows that <span class=\"math\">−2 + (−1) = −3. </span>"],"objNames":["wb_math_vertical_or_horizontal_add_vectors","wb_math_vertical_add_vectors"]}
