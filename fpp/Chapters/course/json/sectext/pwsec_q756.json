A lodestone is a rock with a strong, long-lasting magnetic field. Lodestones occur naturally.","The fields of many magnets, including iron compass needles, weaken over time. Navigators used lodestones to re-magnetize their weakened compass needles, relying on their persistent strength. ","One material in lodestone is iron. Iron does not keep its magnetism for very long. However, when fully magnetized, it has a very strong magnetic field.","In addition to iron, a lodestone contains another material that maintains its magnetic field longer, even if the field it creates is less strong. This means that a lodestone is not only strong, but it keeps its magnetic field for a long time, making it a reliable source of magnetism."],"objNames":["wb_lodestones_concepts"]}
