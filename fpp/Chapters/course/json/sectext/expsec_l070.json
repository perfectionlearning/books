Both have the same initial and final pressure and volume points. In Cycle 1, the gas in the engine starts at a pressure of <span class=\"math\">1.0×10<sup>5</sup> Pa</span> and volume of <span class=\"math\">2.0×10<sup>−2</sup> m<sup>3</sup></span>.","Heat is applied to the gas. The gas is not allowed to expand. The flow of heat increases both the temperature and pressure of the gas. The gas does no work in this step because its volume does not change. ","The gas expands at a constant pressure. It is doing positive work. If this were a real engine, it might be a piston connected to a mechanism in a car to supply power to the wheels. ","The work done by the gas equals the area under the top horizontal line, which is shaded. ","The pressure of the gas is reduced by letting heat escape, reducing its temperature, keeping the volume constant. The gas does no work during this step.","The piston lowers with the pressure constant. The gas does negative work, the signed area under the bottom horizontal line. It is negative work because the direction of the force of the gas on the lid is opposite the direction of the lid’s displacement.","The gas has returned to its initial state. The cycle can be repeated. The net work done by the gas equals the shaded area of the rectangle. "],"objNames":["wb_work_depends_cycle_concepts1"]}
