How is the center of mass of an object affected by movement and collisions?","  <b>Enduring Understandings:<\/b>  <b>    <br \/>  <\/b>1. The momentum for objects with mass can be calculated using the object's mass and its velocity.<br \/>2. The impulse of an object can be calculated using the change in momentum of an object, or the force acting on it over an elapsed time.<br \/>3. The final and initial momentum of a system is conserved.<br \/>4. In an elastic collision, the momentum of a system remains constant and the total kinetic energy of a system does not change. Kinetic energy is conserved.<br \/>5. In an inelastic collision, the momentum of a system remains constant, while the kinetic energy of a system changes. Kinetic energy is not conserved.<br \/>6. The center of mass is the average location of mass of an object.<br \/>7. Apply physics principles such as momentum and velocity to an object's center of mass.","  <b>Vocabulary:<\/b> center of mass, collision, completely inelastic collision, conservation of momentum, elastic collision, impulse, inelastic collision, momentum"],"objNames":[]}
