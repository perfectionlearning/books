","In a completely inelastic collision, the objects stick together after the collision. Two trains connecting, like those we show here, provide an example of a completely inelastic collision. ","Because the objects in a completely inelastic collision stick together, they have the same velocity after the collision.  For example, the trains share a common velocity after the collision. ","The equation for the final velocity for the objects in a completely inelastic collision can be derived using the law of conservation of momentum and some algebra. The result is shown here.
