Assign each pair one of Newton\u2019s Laws. Ask each pair to develop an outline for a PowerPoint, Keynote, or Google Slides presentation of the assigned law. Encourage students to find photos, audio, and\/or video on the Internet to embed into their presentations. Review the outlines as a class, encouraging feedback from the students. The pairs can then complete the slideshows and present them to the class.<b><br \/><\/b>"],"objNames":[]}
