    "Artificial gravity is often featured in science fiction stories.",
    "The space station we discuss is far from any planet or star that would exert any significant gravitational force on our astronauts. To create the sensation of gravity, artificial gravity, engineers have designed a rotating spacecraft.",
    "The astronaut moves in a circle as the space station rotates, and is accelerating, so there must be a net force on her toward the center, what we call a centripetal force. The <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_normal_force_definition'>normal force</a> from the floor of the space station provides the centripetal force. ",
    "Usually when we feel a force up on our feet, it is the normal force countering our weight, that is, the force of gravity. An astronaut here feels a normal force pressing “up‿ on her feet, so she assumes gravity is pulling her “down‿. The design of the space station means the inhabitants can move and walk around as they are accustomed to doing on Earth."
