    "Artificial gravity is often featured in science fiction stories.    ",
    "The space station we discuss is far from any planet or star that would create an amount of gravity that astronauts would sense. To create artificial gravity, a force that astronauts will think feels like gravity, engineers have designed a rotating spacecraft.",
    "The astronaut moves in a circle as the space station rotates, so there must be a centripetal force on her. The <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_normal_force_definition'>normal force</a> from the floor of the space station is the centripetal force. ",
    "Usually when we feel a force up on our feet, it is the normal force countering the force of gravity. An astronaut feels a force up on her feet, so she assumes gravity is pulling her down. The design of the space station means the inhabitants can move and walk around as they are accustomed to doing on Earth."
