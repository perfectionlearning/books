    "Artists (and computer and television manufacturers) can use human <b>inability</b> to resolve dots (or pixels) to good effect. Although telescopes are designed to provide resolution, electronic displays (and sometimes art) are often intended to take advantage of the human eye’s limitations in resolution. ",
    "Art such as the image shown in the diagram takes advantage of the eye’s limitations. The overall picture is of a toy mouse train. But in the part of the picture we expand, you can see the colored dots that make up the overall image. There, you can see each dot as a separate dot because your eye has the ability to resolve them.",
    "In the overall picture, it is difficult to distinguish the individual dots, because your eye lacks the resolving power to separate such small and closely spaced objects.  Artists take advantage of this limitation of resolving power, as do computer monitors and <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_display_technology1'>cell phone displays</a>, which in essence are made up of little “dots” that combine to form an overall image.
