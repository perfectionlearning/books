The study of this topic is called dynamics. A force can cause acceleration. It can cause an object to speed up, slow down, and change direction.  ","A force pushes or pulls.  A ball hitting a bat, or Earth pulling you down are examples of forces, as is the alien pushing the shopping cart. Some forces require contact: a bat hitting a ball, a child pulling a wagon, and so on.  These are called contact forces.","Other forces do not require contact.  Earth pulls on the Moon with the gravitational force, keeping it in orbit \u2212 without touching it, of course.  Another example of force that does not require contact is the magnetic force. Two magnets can attract or repel without contact. ","Forces are vectors.  Their direction matters \u2212 the acceleration of an object will be in the same direction as the net force acting on it. The unit for force is the newton. ","Forces are a common part of our lives.  We have named many of them: friction, a force that opposes motion, or gravity, the force of masses attracting one another. To mention a third: tension is a force transmitted through a string or rope, as we show in the second diagram. "],"objNames":["wb_force_concept","wb_force_examples"]}
