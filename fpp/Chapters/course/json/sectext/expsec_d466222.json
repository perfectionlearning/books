    "We show in the video how the velocity components change as a car rounds a curve. We have gauges for each velocity component. The straight roads are parallel to the <i>y-</i> or to the <i>x</i>-axis.  The car starts moving along the <i>y</i>-axis.  It has positive <i>y</i>-velocity and its <i>x</i>-velocity is 0, as we show in the diagram.",
    "As we steer the car around the curve, the <i>x</i>-velocity is no longer zero.  It becomes positive since we are moving to the right.  As we go around the curve, the <i>x</i>-velocity increases and the <i>y-</i>velocity decreases.",
    "As we exit the curve and move parallel to the <i>x</i>-axis, the <i>y</i>-velocity becomes zero, and the <i>x</i>-velocity remains positive.  As long as we stay parallel to the <i>x</i>-axis, the <i>y</i>-velocity will remain zero."
