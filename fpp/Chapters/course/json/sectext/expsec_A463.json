Katherine, shown in both diagrams, observes the professor roll by on a skateboard while tossing and catching an eraser.  We show this in the upper diagram.","From her reference frame, the eraser moves both horizontally and vertically. She measures the time between the throw and the catch with a stopwatch and finds that the interval between the two events is 1.11 seconds.","Now let\u2019s consider the perception of motion from the professor\u2019s reference frame. His reference frame moves with him, in the same direction and at the same speed.  We show this in the lower diagram.","As this shows, the measured velocity of an object depends on the reference frame.  Since other properties of an object, such as momentum or kinetic energy are also functions of velocity and speed, they too depend on the observer\u2019s reference frame. To take a more extreme case, the pencil on your desk is at rest relative to you, but it is hurtling through space at very high speed according to an astronaut on the Moon.\u00a0 The amount of the pencil's kinetic energy differs according to the observer\u2019s reference frame.","In the professor\u2019s reference frame, the eraser does not move horizontally. It goes directly up and then returns directly down. He also measures the time between the throw and catch with his stopwatch and finds it takes the same 1.11 seconds that Katherine timed. There is no \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d reference frame \u2212 precision is required in specifying reference frames when motion is being described.
