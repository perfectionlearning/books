Katherine, shown in both diagrams, observes the professor roll by on a skateboard while tossing and catching an eraser.  We show this in the upper diagram.","From her reference frame, the eraser moves both horizontally and vertically. She measures the time between the throw and the catch with a stopwatch and finds that the interval between the two events is 1.11 seconds.","Now let’s consider the perception of motion from the professor’s reference frame. His reference frame moves with him, in the same direction and at the same speed.  We show this in the lower diagram.","In the professor’s reference frame, the eraser does not move horizontally. It goes directly up and then returns directly down. He also measures the time between the throw and catch with his stopwatch and finds it takes the same 1.11 seconds that Katherine timed. There is no “right” or “wrong” reference frame − precision is required in specifying reference frames when motion is being described. "],"objNames":["wb_reference_frame1","wb_reference_frame2"]}
