Liquids, gases, and plasmas are all examples of [OBJ:expsec_j354:fluids]. Fluids flow and match the shape of their container.<br />2. [OBJ:expsec_j355:Pressure] is calculated by dividing the force being applied by the area over which the force is applied.<br />3. The [OBJ:expsec_j357:density] of an object is calculated by dividing the mass of an object by its volume.","  <b>Vocabulary:</b>  [OBJ:expsec_j354:fluids], [OBJ:expsec_j355:pressure], [OBJ:expsec_j357:density]","  <b>STEM Skills:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1.
