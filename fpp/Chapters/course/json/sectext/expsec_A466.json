They depend on the observer\u2019s reference frame.  ","In our scenario, the professor has measured the time interval between a throw and catch. We call this measurement the \u201cproper\u201d time interval.  A student in the classroom, Katherine, who is watching the professor pass by, measures the time interval between the events as well. If she and the professor compare notes afterward, they will find out they measured different intervals of time between the events.  ","Time passes more slowly in the professor\u2019s reference frame than when measured by clocks in Katherine\u2019s reference frame. If the professor is moving at everyday speeds, the time difference will be minor \u2212 far, far too small for any wristwatch or stopwatch to measure.  ","The situation is perfectly symmetrical. If the professor had clocks in his reference frame and measured Katherine\u2019s age as she moved by, he would find her aging more slowly as well.

The equation also shows that at slow speeds, the difference in time intervals is miniscule, since the square of the speed of light is enormous compared to the square of everyday speeds."],"objNames":["wb_time_dilation2","wb_time_d_equation"]}
