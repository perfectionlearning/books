The red dot in the Slinky, representing a single particle, moves up and down. ","The particle moves perpendicularly to the direction of the wave. When the particles move perpendicularly to the wave\u2019s direction, the wave is transverse.","Although we are looking at a particular mechanical wave as an example of a transverse wave, not all mechanical waves are transverse waves, as we will discuss. However, all electromagnetic waves are transverse waves because the electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to the direction of the wave\u2019s motion."],"objNames":["wb_transverse_wave_concept"]}
