There are four fundamental forces. The [OBJ:expsec_v059:gravitational force] is the force that attracts two masses to each other. The [OBJ:expsec_v059:electromagnetic force] is the force between two charged particles or on a charge moving in a magnetic field. The [OBJ:expsec_v060:strong force] holds the nucleus together by attracting protons and neutrons to each other. The [OBJ:expsec_v060:weak force] allows the neutron to divide into neutrinos, electrons, and protons.<br />2. A nucleus is [OBJ:expsec_v062:stable] when it does not spontaneously decay. An [OBJ:expsec_v062:unstable] element decays into more stable elements.<br />3. The [OBJ:expsec_v066:energy of an object] at rest is equal to its mass multiplied by the speed of light squared.","  <b>Vocabulary:</b>  [OBJ:expsec_v060:strong force], [OBJ:expsec_v060:weak force], [OBJ:expsec_v062:stable], [OBJ:expsec_v062:unstable], [OBJ:expsec_v063:nuclide], [OBJ:expsec_v064:binding energy]","  <b>STEM Skills:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1.
