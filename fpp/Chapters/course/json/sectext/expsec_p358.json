The potential difference divided by the resistance equals the current.

The current through a conductor increases with the potential difference across the two endpoints of the conductor and decreases with the conductor\u2019s resistance.","This law holds true, and the resistance remains constant, for materials that are called \u201cohmic.\u201d Very important substances, like semiconductors, are non-ohmic. ","The unit for resistance is the ohm.  It is represented by the capital Greek letter omega, \u2126. ","Ohm\u2019s law is used often, so we also solve the equation for the potential difference and the resistance.  "],"objNames":["wb_resistance_concepts","wb_ohm_equation"]}
