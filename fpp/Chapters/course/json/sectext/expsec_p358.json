    "Potential difference determines amount of “the pull” that the electric charges that make up a current will experience. The potential difference divided by the resistance equals the current.  The greater the resistance, the smaller the current.",
    "Ohm’s law states the relationship between current, potential difference, and resistance. The current through a conductor increases with the potential difference across the two endpoints of the conductor and decreases with the conductor’s resistance.",
    "This law holds true, and the resistance remains constant, for materials that are called “ohmic.” Very important substances, like semiconductors, are non-ohmic. ",
    "The unit for resistance is the ohm.  It is represented by the capital Greek letter omega, Ω. ",
    "Ohm’s law is used often, so we also solve the equation for the potential difference and the resistance.  "
