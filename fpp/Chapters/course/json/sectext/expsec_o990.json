Properties of electrostatic equilibrium explain some important properties of an object’s electric field.","We start the discussion of electrostatic equilibrium by considering charges that are not free to move.  The charges are distributed randomly.  ","When allowed to move, they travel as far away from one another as they can. They do this since like charges repel, and this reduces the forces between them. They stop moving and are in electrostatic equilibrium.","An important consequence of the charge configuration at electrostatic equilibrium is the resulting electric field.  Outside of a charged, solid conducting sphere, there is an electric field generated by the charges on the surface. More important is the lack of a field inside the sphere. We show a chunk of the sphere as transparent so you can see inside it. There is <b>no</b> electric field inside the conductor. ","In the second diagram, we show how a charged sphere shields its contents from an external field. We use two charged plates to create a sample field. The external field does not penetrate the sphere.  This occurs because all of the net charge is on the sphere’s exterior, and there is no field inside the sphere. Metal containers of different shapes, which do not have to be solid, serve to shield their contents. "],"objNames":["wb_electrostatic_equlibrium1","wb_electrostatic_equlibrium2"]}
