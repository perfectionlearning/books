For example, digital instruments often have different sensitivities that may be selected.","Making sure the equipment is in good repair will also improve precision. ","In labs, you will want your data to be as precise and accurate as possible.","There are several ways to improve accuracy.  One is to perform the same experiment multiple times and to average the results.","Another is to calibrate the equipment, to adjust it for accuracy.  This usually involves making a measurement of a known value and adjusting the equipment to reflect that known value. For example, a thermometer probe can be dipped into boiling water, and the instrument should read 100 degrees Celsius.","Look for obvious errors.  Are some of the data points unexpected, based on the trend you were seeing?  It may reflect an interesting new trend, or it may simply be a mistake, such as writing down a value incorrectly.  See if you can observe the result again."],"objNames":["wb_precision_labs","wb_accuracy_labs"]}
