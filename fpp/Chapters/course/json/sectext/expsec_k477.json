We want to determine the specific heat of an object. We start by measuring its mass and initial temperature. As our diagram shows, it is then placed inside the calorimeter.  We have measured the amount and temperature of the water in the calorimeter. ","The object usually starts out at a higher temperature than the water.  Heat flows from the object to the surrounding water.  ","The object and water will reach thermal equilibrium over time \u2212 at equilibrium the water\u2019s temperature reaches a stable value.  This is the temperature we use for the calculation. ","Values that we do know include the specific heat of water, its temperature change, and its mass.  This means the amount of heat the water absorbed can be calculated. ","Because the calorimeter is insulated, the heat came from the object. The heat is divided by the product of the object\u2019s mass and the change in temperature, and that quotient equals the specific heat of the material that makes up the object.  We do a <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='app_calorimeter_question'>sample problem<\/a> showing how this is done in another section.","We describe calculating specific heat, but a calorimeter may be used for other experiments, such as calculating a material\u2019s heat of fusion by letting something melt."],"objNames":["wb_calorimeter_concept2"]}
