How can we use scientific notation to perform operations on large or small numbers?<br />3. How can we use significant figures to write precise numbers?<br />4. What is the nature of science?<br />5. How can we conduct a science experiment?<br />6. How can we evaluate algebraic expressions?","  <b>Enduring Understandings:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1. Exponents state how many times to multiply the base of a power.<b><br /></b>2. In science, the metric system is used to measure quantities.<b><br /></b>3. A conversion factor is used to convert between units and prefixes.<b><br /></b>4. Dimensional analysis can be used to confirm the correct units in a calculation.<br />6. Scientific notation is used to write both large and small numbers.<b><br /></b>7. The product and quotient rules are used to multiply and divide powers.<b><br /></b>8. Numbers in scientific notation can be multiplied and divided using the product and quotient rules.<br />9. Significant figures are used to convey a precise number.<b><br /></b>10. When multiplying and dividing numbers, the number of significant digits in the answer remains the same as the number with the least amount of significant digits in the calculation. When adding and subtracting numbers with significant digits, the answer has the same amount of significant digits as the number with the least amount of decimal places in the calculation.<br />11. Science is the study of natural phenomena and the creation of testable explanations to explain behavior. <b><br /></b>12. A hypothesis is an explanation of natural phenomena based on evidence. A theory is a hypothesis that has been tested so extensively that it is considered to be true.<b><br /></b>13. Science questions can be tested. The evidence gathered based on science can be used to form ethical decisions.<b><br /></b>14. Physicists throughout history have contributed to science and society.<br />15. A testable question will guide the design of an experiment. <b><br /></b>16. The variables of an experiment should be identified to determine what data is important to record. The procedure should be written so that someone else can replicate the experiment.<b><br /></b>17. Precision is a measure of how exact a measurement can be, while accuracy is how close to the true value a measurement is.<b><br /></b>18. Determine if the data is close to what is expected by evaluating the data for reasonableness.<b><br /></b>19. Present the results of an experiment by completing a write-up that includes an introduction, hypothesis, experimental procedure, variables, data presented as tables or graphs, data analysis, and conclusion.<br />20. When evaluating expressions, first evaluate the parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, and then subtraction (PEMDAS).","  <b>Vocabulary:</b> accuracy, conversion factor, dimensional analysis, dividing numbers in scientific, significant figures, exponent, metric system, multiplying numbers in scientific notation,  negative exponents, order of operations, power, precision, prefixes, product rule, quotient rule, the result of adding or subtracting two numbers notation, the result of multiplying or dividing two numbers, scientific notation, unit"],"objNames":[]}
