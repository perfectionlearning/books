As we said earlier, the second law states that no engine is 100% efficient. ","In considering real-world engines, such an internal combustion engine in a car, one can detect the signs of \u201cwaste\u201d heat being produced.  Some of the energy produced by burning the gasoline goes to the useful work of making the car move, but some of the energy exits the tailpipe as heat, which does no useful work.","One way to detect the heat is just to feel the hot hood of a car after it has been running. Also, a car engine\u2019s radiator is designed to absorb heat. As it absorbs that heat, the temperature of the fluid in the radiator rises. The temperature increase means that entropy increases. This increase in entropy confirms that the engine is not 100% efficient. ","In addition to using our real-world engine as an example, we can use the model of the heat engine that we used earlier. A 100% efficient engine would absorb heat from the hot reservoir, lowering the entropy of the hot reservoir, convert all of the heat to mechanical work, and then return to its initial state, without having transferred any heat to the cold reservoir. This would mean that the entropy of the universe decreased, which violates the second law."],"objNames":["wb_entropy_efficiciency1","wb_entropy_efficiency2"]}
