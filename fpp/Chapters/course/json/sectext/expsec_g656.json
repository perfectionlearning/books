","Impulse is the product of the net force and the elapsed time.  The force applied by the cannon supplies an impulse to the daredevil, changing his momentum. While the daredevil is in the cannon, we treat the cannon’s force as the net force acting on him. ","The cannon is designed to apply a large amount of impulse. First, its explosion supplies a strong force.  Second, the length of the cannon barrel extends how long the force is applied.    ","Impulse also equals the change in momentum.  The cannon changes the daredevil’s momentum by applying an impulse.  ","Impulse is a vector represented by <b>J</b>. It has the same direction as the net force. Impulse equals the product of the net force and elapsed time.  The net force is assumed to be an average or constant amount. ","Impulse also equals the change in momentum.  We show this as the second equation. Impulse equals Δ<b>p</b>, since <b>p</b> represents momentum."],"objNames":["wb_impulse","wb_impulse_equation"]}
