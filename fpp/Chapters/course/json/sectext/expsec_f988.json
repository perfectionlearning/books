If only conservative forces do work, a system’s energy remains constant.","Gravity is an example of a conservative force. When the roller coaster car returns to its original position, the net work done on it by gravity is zero. As the car goes downhill, the work done on it by gravity is positive. As it goes uphill, gravity opposes the motion and the work is negative. After the car makes a complete trip around the track, we find that the net work done by gravity is zero, that is, the positive work it does exactly cancels its negative work.","With a conservative force, the work done does not depend on the path taken by the object, as long as the endpoints are the same. In other words, when the object completes a loop.","The roller coaster could move forward 10 meters and then backward 10 meters, or make 1,000 trips around the track, and the net work done by gravity is still zero.
