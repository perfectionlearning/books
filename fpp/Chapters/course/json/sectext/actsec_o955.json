{"cards":[{"lines":[{"type":"title","text":"Proton golf"}]}],"definitions":[],"secText":["For some fun, you can play “proton golf” to explore the force between charged particles. The ball is positively charged, and you add protons to the putter to make it positively charged as well. The protons in the putter exert a force, called the electric force, on the ball even when the two are not touching. ","You can control both the location of the putter, by dragging it, and how many protons it contains, by clicking the up- and down-arrows in the console. The moment you load protons into the putter they exert a force on the ball, but the ball is locked in place until you press PUTT. The grass of the green supplies a frictional force that will eventually cause the ball to stop rolling.","Your mission, as always in golf, is to sink the ball in the hole <span class=\"Symbols\">−</span> in four or fewer shots, if you can! The important thing (in addition to having fun) is to observe how the electric force relates to the amount of charge on two charged objects, and to the distance between them. ","Be warned, though: Obstacles do exist! A clump of protons acts like a hill that causes the ball to roll away from it, while a clump of electrons is a sand trap that will attract the ball.
