    "As with other mechanical waves, the speed of a sound wave depends on the properties of the medium through which the wave travels.",
    "As the first table shows, sound tends to travel faster in <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_liquids_concept1'>liquids</a> than in <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_gas_concept1'>gases</a>, and faster in <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_solids_concept1'>solids</a> than in liquids. The nature and strength of the interactions between particles determines the speed of sound.  ",
    "The tighter linkages between particles in a solid transmit sound faster than a liquid.  And sounds travel slowest in a gas, where collisions between generally widely separated particles transmit the sound.",
    "The speed of sound in air also depends on the air temperature.  For instance, when a gas becomes warmer, its particles move faster and collide more frequently. This enables a sound wave to travel faster. The second table shows how the speed at which sound travels in air increases with temperature."
