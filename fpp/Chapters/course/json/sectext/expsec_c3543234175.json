The periodic table is organized into columns, with two of the columns highlighted in the diagram you see.","The periodic table is divided into metals and nonmetals. A metal, such as gold or iron, tends to be a good conductor of electricity and heat. Metals are located on the left side of the table. They bond with nonmetals. Examples of a nonmetal include oxygen and nitrogen. Their properties are opposite to those of metals.","As you go from left to right in rows of the table, each element has one more electron. Hydrogen starts with one, then you move to helium (He) in the same row with two, move down to the next row with lithium (Li) with three, and so on.","The vertical columns of the periodic table are ordered by the number of valence electrons in the elements. The first column on the left side of the table, which we highlight, is called column IA, and is a set of elements that all have a single valence electron. ","Outside hydrogen atop that first column, all the elements in that column are alkali metals. These elements tend to be highly reactive with the elements in column VIIA, so named because those elements have seven valence electrons. Elements in these two columns bond since adding one to seven makes for a stable eight, or subtracting one makes for a stable lower shell."],"objNames":["wb_periodictable_2"]}
