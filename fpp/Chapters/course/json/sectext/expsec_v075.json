    "Here is a group of radioactive iodine-131 atoms, with one indicated by an arrow. When will that particular atom decay? There is no definite answer for that or any other atom âˆ’ it is impossible to know exactly when a specific atom will decay. ",
    "It is only possible to state the probability of a particular particle decaying.  With a large number of particles, one can confidently state that very close to half of those particles will decay during a half-life period. ",
    "  <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_quantum_concepts'>Quantum mechanics</a> governs radioactive decay. A person cannot state exactly when any one atom will decay, only the probability of it decaying within a certain time interval. For example, for any atom of iodine-131, the probability is one-half that it will decay within the next 8.04 days. To emphasize a point, with a large sample of iodine, say a trillion of them, one could confidently predict that about 500 billion (one half) of them would decay in those 8.04 days."
