The sound wave becomes an electrical signal with the same frequency. A device called an analog-to-digital converter measures the potential difference at regular intervals.  ","The device then converts the samples into a digital form.  In other words, the original analog signal is now represented with the 0s and 1s of digital bits, grouped together in <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_digital_bits'>bytes<\/a>.","The converter samples the signal frequently, with 8 kHz being a typical frequency for sampling voice communication, and higher rates for music.","The digital information is stored or transmitted.
