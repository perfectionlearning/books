We start by reviewing the interference patterns formed by light. ","The upper diagram shows a light interference pattern. By shining light through small slits in a diffraction grating, the wavelike nature of light can be observed. ","If particles such as electrons have wavelike properties, can these properties be observed? Yes, they can be, by using a setup similar to that used with light. Electrons must pass through incredibly narrow slits (on the order of 0.1 nanometers) to create a diffraction pattern like the one you see in the lower diagram.","Creating such thin slits is hard work. However, some metallic crystals have spaces between their atoms that are comparable to the necessary slit widths. In 1927, two American physicists named Davisson and Germer accidentally observed an electron diffraction pattern while using an electron beam to study the surface of a nickel crystal. As is often the case, scientists in other countries were conducting similar investigations with the same outcome.  Davission shared his Nobel Prize with the British scientist George Paget Thompson for their discovery of diffraction of electrons by crystals."],"objNames":["wb_observe_matter1","wb_observe_matter2"]}
