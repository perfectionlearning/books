How do we calculate the work done? In this section, we show a way to approximate the amount of work done. ","In the diagram is a graph of a force that varies with displacement. As the graph shows, the force reaches a maximum when the displacement is two and a half meters. The area under the curve equals the work. If the graph of the force were made of straight lines, calculating the area underneath would be exact and relatively easy. But with a curve, a little more effort is required. ","One way to approximate the area under the curve is to fit a set of rectangles to the curve, as shown in the diagram. In this case, we use five rectangles, which give us a good approximation. If we wanted to be more accurate, we would use more rectangles. The more the merrier, and the more accurate. ","Why does this method work?  Work is the product of force and displacement.  For a small displacement, the force is approximately constant, and the area of each rectangle is the product, which approximates the work done over that small displacement.  Summing all the rectangles approximates the total area under the curve, which is the total work. "],"objNames":["wb_work_changing_force"]}
