[OBJ:expsec_e777:Free-body diagrams] are representations of the forces acting upon an object. The forces in a free-body diagram start from the origin of the object and point in the direction of the force. The length of the force vector corresponds to the magnitude of the force.<b><br /></b>2. Free-body diagrams can be drawn for objects when the [OBJ:expsec_e778:forces are not acting on a line]. The same rules for drawing free-body diagrams for forces acting on a line apply to free-body diagrams for forces not acting on a line.","  <b>Vocabulary:</b>  [OBJ:expsec_e777:free-body diagram]","  <b>STEM Skills:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1.
