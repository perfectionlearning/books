{"cards":[{"lines":[{"type":"title","text":"Set the correct engine force to land the lunar module"}]}],"definitions":[],"secText":["You are in training to be an astronaut. In one of your training simulations, your goal is to land a lunar excursion module (LEM) on the surface of the Moon. This LEM has two rocket engines attached to the center of the craft. The engines typically point at angles of 22.0\u00b0 in opposite directions from the negative <i>y<\/i>-axis, and they generate equal amounts of thrust. This means that as they fire, they provide a combined upward force that does not cause the rocket to move to the right or left.","In an \u201caccident\u201d intended to test your astronaut skills, the right rocket (labeled B) is bent to a 39.0\u00b0 angle. The illustration shows these two angles. In spite of this problem, you are still expected to guide the LEM straight down.","As the simulation starts, the module is moving downward toward the landing pad. In this \u201cemergency,\u201d the amount of thrust force from the left engine, labeled A, is jammed at 35,600 N.","You are allowed to set the amount of force from the right engine. You need to set this amount so there is no net horizontal force. Small attitude rockets at the top of the LEM will keep it from rotating, but it will drift left or right if you enter the wrong values. Enter the force to the nearest 100 N.
