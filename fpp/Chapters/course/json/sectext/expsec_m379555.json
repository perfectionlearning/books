The amplitude of a wave is the height of a peak measured from equilibrium. The amplitude of a wave is always a positive value, because it is the greatest distance from equilibrium, and distance is never negative.","Period and frequency are also used to describe waves. Just like in simple harmonic motion, the period of a wave is the time to complete one cycle.","Frequency also uses the same definition as simple harmonic motion. The frequency is the number of cycles per second."],"objNames":["wb_wave_amplitude_wave","wb_wave_freq_period_wave"]}
