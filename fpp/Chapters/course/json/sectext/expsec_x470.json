In this section, we discuss the energy gap between bands in a semiconductor, and contrast the band gaps of conductors, semiconductors, and insulators. ","A semiconductor is sort of the “mama bear” of materials. It rests in the middle between insulators and conductors in terms of the gap between the valence and conducting bands. ","There is a moderate energy gap between the bands. In addition, materials scientists can “tweak” the material to change the size of the gap between the bands. ","At the bottom, we put the three diagrams next to each other so you can see the contrast between them. The energy gaps are on the order of one electron volt for a semiconductor and eight electron volts for an insulator.  The varying energy gaps of conductors, semiconductors, and insulators explains their electrical conduction properties. "],"objNames":["wb_atom_energy_levels5","wb_atom_energy_levels6"]}
