You can start your experimentation by dragging two masses onto the screen. The purple vectors represent the gravitational forces between them.","You can move a mass around the screen and see how the gravitational forces change. What is the relationship between the amounts of the forces and the distance between the masses? Do the masses exert the same amount of force on each other?","Also try bringing out bodies with different masses.  For example, experiment with the bodies 4m and m. The 4m body has four times the mass of the m body.  Do you see a relationship between the product of the masses and the magnitude of the gravitational force? "],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_13_0"]}
