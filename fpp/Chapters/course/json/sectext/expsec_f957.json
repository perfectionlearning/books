In other words, work occurs when the force is at an angle to the displacement.","To illustrate this concept, the diagram shows a woman is pulling a crate.  She applies her force at an angle to the direction of displacement. With the force and displacement vectors not in the same direction, only the component of the force in the direction of the displacement contributes to the work. ","Any force lifting up or pushing down on the crate does not help to accelerate it in the direction of the displacement.   In our example here, it is only the <i>x</i>-component of the force that does any work, since that is the component parallel to the displacement. ","The equation you see includes the cosine function. <i>F </i>cos <i><math xmlns:xsl=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\"><mi>θ</mi></math></i> is the component of force that is parallel to the displacement. In the crate example in this section, the expression calculates the <i>x</i>-component of the force, which is the component parallel to the displacement. The work equals the product of that component of the force and the displacement. "],"objNames":["wb_work_concept_angle","wb_work_trig_equation"]}
