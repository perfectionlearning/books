We discuss this relationship using a simple engine system. ","As you can see in the diagram, our model of an engine includes a container that holds a gas. A flame supplies heat to the engine. ","The heat added by the flame can increase the gas\u2019s thermal energy.  The gas molecules have greater kinetic energy and move faster. This would be measured as an increase in temperature.  On the other hand, if heat flowed out of the system, the gas\u2019s thermal energy would be reduced and its temperature would fall.","The system can also do work.  In our example, the system is expanding a piston, applying a force in the direction of the displacement, doing positive work.  Some of the heat transferred to the system now goes to doing work, instead of raising its thermal energy. ","The change in energy of the system equals the net heat flow minus the work the system does.  This law is an application of conservation of energy.  A change in a system\u2019s thermal energy equals any net energy transfer to it by heat, minus any work the system does. ","The first law of thermodynamics can be written as an equation.  The change in a system\u2019s thermal energy equals the net energy transferred to it by heat minus the work done <u>by<\/u> the system.
