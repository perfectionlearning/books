The two waves that combine are shown in light orange and pink, and the combined wave is black.","The individual waves have the same amplitude, wavelength, and speed. However, they have a phase difference, which is set by you.","Can you determine in advance a phase difference that will cause a combined wave with the greatest amplitude? What about a phase difference that will cause a wave with the smallest amplitude? What occurs for phases in between these phase differences? Create your hypotheses and use the simulation to test them."],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_18_13"]}
