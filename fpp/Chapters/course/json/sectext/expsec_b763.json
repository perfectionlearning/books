For example, falling down the stairs is different than walking up them. To include information about direction, scientists define concepts such as displacement and velocity. ","The definition of displacement is the length of the shortest path between the initial and final points, which is the distance, and in what direction. This means displacement is a vector.   ","The car we show moved to the left and stopped. This means it has negative displacement, since it moved in the negative direction along the number line. ","Distance is always zero or positive. Displacement can be negative, zero, or positive.  Positive and negative is one way to indicate the direction of displacement. Positive is used for displacement to the right or up, and negative for displacement to the left or down. ","We also use the vector arrow you see in the top diagram to represent the car’s displacement.  The vector points in the direction of the displacement and its length represents the amount. ","The equation for displacement is simple: Subtract the initial position from the final position.  We remind you the triangle is pronounced “delta.”  It represents change, which here is the change in position. As noted above, displacement along the <i>x</i>-axis is positive to the right, and negative to the left. "],"objNames":["actwb_displacement_definition","wb_displacement_equation"]}
