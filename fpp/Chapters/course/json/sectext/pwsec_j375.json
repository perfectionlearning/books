The solid steel bar has greater density than water. The amount of water it displaces has less weight than the steel bar’s weight, so the buoyant force is less than the weight.  The net force down means the steel bar sinks.","If an object is less dense than water, it only has to be partially submerged to float.  When the wood block is submerged as shown, the weight of the water it displaces is equal to the block’s weight, and there is no net force.  The block will stay at this level.","The ship floats even though steel is denser than water.  If the ship were solid steel, it would sink.","The ship’s steel structure contains air and other materials − it is not solid steel.  The average density of the ship is less than that of water.  When this amount of the boat is submerged, it floats.","This also explains why ships will sink if water floods in, as with the <i>Titanic</i>.  Water is denser than air, and the combination of steel and water is denser than water alone.  A ship full of water has greater average density than water, and will sink."],"objNames":["wb_archimedes_density","wb_steel_boat_floats"]}
