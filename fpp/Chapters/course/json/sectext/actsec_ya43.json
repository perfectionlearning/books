They were supposed to be <b>constant</b> acceleration rabbits, but you worry that some are the less expensive, non-constant acceleration rabbits. In fact, you think two might be the cheaper critters, with acceleration that changes as they move.","Your mission: Determine if you were ripped off, and drag the “½ off” sale tags to the cheaper rabbits. The simulation will let you know if you are correct. You may decide to keep the cuddly creatures, but you want to be fairly charged.","Each rabbit in the simulation has a velocity gauge that you can use to monitor its motion. The simplest way to solve this problem is to consider the rabbits one at a time: look at a rabbit’s velocity gauge and determine if the velocity is changing at a constant rate. If the rate of change is constant, then the acceleration is constant.  No detailed mathematical calculations are required to solve this problem."],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_2_16"]}
