His experiment contrasted quantum theory and our everyday perception of reality. No animals were used or harmed in this thought experiment!","Schrödinger described a cat placed in a sealed chamber that contained a poison gas cylinder.  If released, the poison gas would always kill the cat.  It is impossible to view inside the chamber when its door is closed.","The poison gas release is tied to a quantum process, the radioactive decay of an atom. After one half-life, there is a 50% chance that a particular atom will decay and release the gas.  There is no way to know in advance if the atom will <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_radioactive_2'>decay</a>, so there is no way to know if the gas will be released.  ","Quantum theory states that the cat, before being observed, is in a superposition of two states, being both alive and dead. An observer cannot see within the chamber, so the fate of the cat can only be observed after it is opened."],"objNames":["wb_schrodinger1"]}
