","In this grating spectroscope, white light passes through the collimating tube we show and reaches the diffraction grating. The angle at which a certain color of light comes off gives a precise measure of the wavelength.","By measuring the wavelengths of light from a certain multicolored source with a grating spectroscope, the composition of that source can be deduced. In the lower diagram, we show the spectral emission lines for hydrogen. In other words, hydrogen emits light at these particular wavelengths.
