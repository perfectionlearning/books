The suitcase is being accelerated up since the force up is shown as greater than the force down.   The force of gravity pulls the suitcase down. The force from the woman lifting the suitcase pulls the suitcase up.  These are the only two forces acting on the suitcase. ","We show the free-body diagram for the suitcase in the lower diagram. As you can see, we draw all the forces acting at the origin. ","The direction of each vector points in the same direction as the force it represents, as vectors always do.  The vector arrows show that the force due to the woman lifting the suitcase is directed up, while the force of gravity is directed down.","The length of the vectors is proportional to their magnitude, as they always should be. The force of the woman lifting the suitcase is greater than the force due to gravity. "],"objNames":["wb_multiple_bodies_one_object1","wb_the_freebodydiagram"]}
