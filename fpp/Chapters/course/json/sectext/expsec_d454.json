For example, the car you first drove moved straight back-and-forth along a linear road.  The motion occurs along one dimension, parallel to an axis.","The world is a little more complex than this. Objects do not move only along straight-line paths. A car moving around a curve, a baseball thrown from a tall building − these types of motion take place in more than one dimension.","The car shown on the left moves in two dimensions simultaneously as it goes around the curve. A physicist (and you, shortly) would say that the car moves in both the <span class=\"math\"><i>x-</i></span> and the <span class=\"math\"><i>y</i></span>-directions. Its position along the <span class=\"math\"><i>x-</i></span> and <span class=\"math\"><i>y-</i></span>axes changes as it moves.","We can draw a vector to indicate the car’s displacement.  As with any displacement vector, it starts at the initial position, and ends at the final position. "],"objNames":["wb_two_d_displacement"]}
