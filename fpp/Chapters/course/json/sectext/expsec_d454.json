","For instance, we slide the vector <b>A</b><b></b>shown in the first card 2 units upward and 2 units to the right.   It still describes a vector with the same magnitude and direction, but it now has different starting and ending points.","The components of a vector can be calculated by subtracting the initial (starting) point from its terminal (end) point. When <b>A</b> is at the origin, the subtraction is simple, since subtracting (0, 0) just yields (3, 2), the terminal point. The components are 3 along the <i>x</i>-axis, 2 along the <i>y</i>-axis.","We can confirm that sliding the vector <b>A</b> does not change its components. It now ends at (5, 4) and starts at (2, 2).  We subtract each dimension separately, so (5 − 2, 4 − 2) results in (3, 2). Its components are the same as when the vector was at the origin."],"objNames":["wb_math_vector_coordinates_concept2"]}
