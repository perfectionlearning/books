A magnet moving through the coil induces an <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_AC_circuits'>emf<\/a> in the wire, causing a current that makes the light shine.  ","The strength of the magnetic field is one factor that determines the amount of an induced emf. The stronger the magnetic field of the magnet, the greater the change in the field strength as the magnet moves, and the greater the induced emf. ","Another factor is the speed of the magnet as it passes through the coil. The faster the magnet and its magnetic field pass through the loops of the coil, the greater the induced emf. ","It is the relative motion of field and wire that causes the induction. It does not matter if the coil moves, or the magnet moves, or both move. ","The area of each loop affects the amount of induced emf. When the loops enclose a greater area, the induced emf is greater.","The number of loops in the coil plays a role as well. Each loop contributes to the overall effect. For example, doubling the number of loops doubles the induced emf. "],"objNames":["wb_strength_induced_PD_concepts"]}
