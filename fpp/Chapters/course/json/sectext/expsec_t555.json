The mirror shown in the top illustration reflects light to form the woman\u2019s image. ","The Moon is visible in the lower photograph because light from the Sun reflected off the Moon into the camera. The light changed direction as it reached the Moon, starting in one direction, and moving in a different direction after striking the Moon\u2019s surface.  Different areas of the Moon absorb and reflect different amounts and wavelengths of light, which causes the different shades and colors you see.
