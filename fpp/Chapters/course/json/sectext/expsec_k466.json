    "The variable <i>U</i> represents thermal energy.  The unit for energy is the joule, as always. Another common unit for thermal energy is a calorie.  One joule equals about 0.24 calories. The calorie unit shown on food is a kilocalorie, so one joule equals about 0.00024 kilocalories. You may think that chocolate bars have a lot of (kilo)calories, but they contain even more joules!",
    "The thermal energy of an object is the sum of the thermal energies of all the molecules that it is composed of.  Even small amounts of matter are composed of enormous numbers of molecules. ",
    "For instance, twelve grams of carbon-12, a form of carbon, contains about 6.02×10<sup class=\"\">23 </sup>atoms of carbon. A liter of air contains about a twentieth as many molecules, which is still on the order of 10<sup class=\"\">22</sup> molecules. The thermal energy is the sum of the thermal energies of all these molecules. ",
    "We will often be discussing the change in thermal energy, which is represented with Δ<i>U</i>. Heat and work can change a system’s thermal energy.  "
