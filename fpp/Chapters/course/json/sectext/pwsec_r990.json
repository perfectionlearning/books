","A pixel is typically made up of three subpixels in new systems.  The subpixels are blue, red, and green.  The colors of the subpixels are added to form other colors. ","The intensity of a subpixel can also be controlled.  For instance, in some systems the intensity of each can range across 256 levels.  ","Multiplying 256 by itself three times yields the number of color options for a pixel: over 16 million."],"objNames":["wb_display_technology3"]}
