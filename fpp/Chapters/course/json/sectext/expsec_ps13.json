The top gauge measures the absolute pressure of the gas, which in this case equals the atmospheric pressure plus the pressure due to the weight of the 10-kilogram lid. The second gauge shows the volume of the gas. ","The product of the gas\u2019s pressure and volume is proportional to the product of two factors.  One is the amount of gas, measured in moles. A mole contains 6.022\u00d710<sup class=\"\">23<\/sup> particles.  This is called Avogadro\u2019s number, and it is the number of atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12, a specific form of carbon. ","The other factor in the relationship is pressure. Pressure times volume is also proportional to the molar quantity of the gas and the gas\u2019s temperature, measured on the Kelvin scale. In the configuration shown, the amount of gas is constant, since it cannot escape the cylinder. ","We show what happens when the weight atop the gas increases. Since adding weight increases the pressure exerted by the lid and the gas\u2019s pressure, either the volume of the gas decreases, or its temperature increases, or both. In the animation, we show one possible outcome: the gas\u2019s temperature increases, and its volume decreases."],"objNames":["wb_ideal_concept"]}
