Diffraction helps to explain why we can, or cannot, resolve two objects.","We start by showing a case when two objects can be resolved into separate images. The upper illustration shows the diffraction patterns produced by light from two sources arriving at a detector containing a circular aperture, such as a telescope opening or the pupil of a human eye. The diffracted light falls onto a detector âˆ’ for example, the retina at the back of the eye. When there is little overlap between the diffraction patterns, as in this case, the sources produce two distinct images. This is like seeing the two headlights of a nearby car as two separate lights.  ","In the lower diagram, the diffraction patterns of the two sources overlap. The result is a blurry, ambiguous, or indistinct image. If you look at the headlights of a distant car and cannot be sure if it is one light rather than two, you are experiencing this effect. Your eye does not have sufficient resolving power to see the two lights as separate. "],"objNames":["wb_resolving_concepts2","wb_resolving_concepts3"]}
