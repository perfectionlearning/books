It is important to remember that this equation calculates the <b>change</b> in length, not the new length.","Coefficients of linear expansion for materials are based on Celsius or Kelvin temperatures. The temperature change in either scale is the same, since their units are equal. The unit for length is the meter.  "],"objNames":["wb_linear_expansion_equation"]}
