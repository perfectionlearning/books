In other words, you need to create the conditions for static equilibrium. ","You can calculate the amount of force and where to place it.  You do this by placing vector arrows in the locations you select.  Drag the vector by its tail. You want the forces and the torques to sum to zero."],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_12_7"]}
