For instance: Is <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_kinetic_energy_definition'>kinetic energy<\/a> in a system after a <a class='pjumpToTopic' href='javascript:void(0)' data-chap='7' data-topic='2' data-subtopic='1' data-subsection='0'>collision<\/a> the same, more than, or less than it was before the collision? Kinetic energy is related to the masses and speeds of the colliding objects.  A question like \u201cwhat happens in a collision?\u201d would be much too broad. ","A question should result in a testable <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_hypothesis'>hypothesis<\/a>.  Testable means that your experiment can answer your question with observations.  For instance, \u201ckinetic energy is reduced by collisions\u201d is a testable hypothesis.  ","After you have a testable hypothesis, you design your experiment.  In our example you need a way to measure the speed of the objects before the collision and after, since kinetic energy is a function of speed.  You also need to measure their masses.  ","Part of designing the experiment is choosing the appropriate equipment and technology. You want equipment that provides the most accurate data. Physics labs continue to improve thanks to new equipment, with tools such as video-analysis applications now even available on smart phones. "],"objNames":["wb_design_lab"]}
