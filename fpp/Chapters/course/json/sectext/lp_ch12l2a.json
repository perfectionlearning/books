[OBJ:expsec_l059:Engines] use energy to do work. Engines complete repeating cycles to do work. Engines are not 100% efficient.<br />2. [OBJ:expsec_l060:Heat engines] are used as models of real-world engines. Heat is transferred into the engine, causing work to be done. Heat also flows out of the engine, which contributes to the engine not being 100% efficient.<br />3.  In an engine, the [OBJ:expsec_l061:work done by the engine] is equal to the net heat transfer to the engine.<br />4. [OBJ:expsec_l078:Heat pumps] and [OBJ:expsec_l077:refrigerators] are examples of engines. Refrigerators force heat from a colder environment into a warmer environment. Heat pumps transfer heat from a warmer environment into a colder environment.","  <b>Vocabulary:</b>  [OBJ:expsec_l059:engine], [OBJ:expsec_l060:heat engine], [OBJ:expsec_l077:refrigerator], [OBJ:expsec_l078:heat pump]","  <b>STEM Skills:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1.
