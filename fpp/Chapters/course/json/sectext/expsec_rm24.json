Two 60-inch drops onto the side are also conducted immediately after exposure of the helmet to 120 degrees F for four hours. Shock measurements are taken to determine if the helmet meets an established Severity Index for concussion tolerance and thereby meets the NOCSAE Football Helmet standard test. An equivalent to the 60-inch drop test would occur if a player running at 17.9 feet per second (<span class=\"math\">12.2 mph</span>) ran into a flat surface that stopped his head in less than one inch. Most players run faster than this, i.e., the average speed of a player running 40 yards in 4.8 seconds is 25 feet per second, but very rarely would the head be stopped in such a short distance on the football field.","A logical inference (conclusion) is that this test and the data the NOCSAE presents reflect accurately a collision in football. In the next section, we will begin to analyze the organizationâ€™s statements."],"objNames":["wb_concussions2"]}
