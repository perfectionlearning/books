As with motion, starting with expansion in one dimension makes things easier.","When heated, the rod expands. Here, we concentrate on its increase in length. We call this linear expansion, since it expands along a line. ","The bimetallic strip is made up of two different materials. Their temperatures are the same after they reach thermal equilibrium with their surroundings, but they expand by different amounts, making the strip curl.  They have different expansion constants. ","When the rods expand, the length of the expansion is proportional to the initial length of each rod. These rods are made from the same material, but one is twice as long as the other. Their temperature increases by the same amount, but the longer rod increases in length twice as much. The two rods expand by the same <b>percentage<\/b> of their original lengths, and the ratio of their lengths remains the same."],"objNames":["wb_linear_thermal_concepts1","wb_linear_thermal_concepts2"]}
