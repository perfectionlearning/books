","In turn, explaining the greenhouse effect requires a few steps. We start with radiation from the Sun reaching Earth. Earth absorbs some of this radiation.","The transparent gases in the atmosphere of our planet do not stop much sunlight from passing through to Earth’s surface, but they do absorb the infrared radiation that is emitted from the warmed Earth. ","The gases in the atmosphere absorb radiation, then re-emit that radiation. Some of it leaves Earth’s atmosphere, but some goes back to the surface of Earth. ","The radiation that returns to the surface of Earth causes it to be warmer than it would be without the presence of the atmosphere. This is called the “greenhouse effect.” This process has gone on for millions of years, and it occurs on other planets with atmospheres as well. ","The current concern about global warming and the greenhouse effect centers on the nature of the gases that make up the atmosphere. The burning of coal and petroleum has increased the amount of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere. This increases the magnitude of the greenhouse effect.
