One is the laser medium. Helium-neon gas is a common medium. The medium can be energized, after which it can emit light. ","Energy can be added to the medium in a variety of ways, such as by discharging electricity through it. This is called the “pumping process.” ","With the laser medium excited, light is shone into it to pass back and forth. During each pass, the light causes the medium to emit photons that are focused and concentrated by the container’s mirrored end-walls. This feedback mechanism, the third essential component of a laser, results in the amplification of the light.","The photons interact with the medium, and cause it to emit more photons. The reflective ends of the chamber cause the photons to travel back into the medium, resulting in further amplification. All this happens during a very brief time interval.","The photons are allowed to leave via a narrow exit on the right. As you will see, quantum principles explain why they all have the same phase and frequency."],"objNames":["wb_laser2"]}
