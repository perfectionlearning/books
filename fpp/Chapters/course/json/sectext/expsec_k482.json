In both graphs, temperature is on the vertical axis, and heat added is on the horizontal axis.","The first graph represents the heating curve for one kilogram of water at a constant pressure. ","Adding heat can increase temperature, as it does where the slope in the heating curve is positive like in the areas labeled ice, water, and steam. For each, the slopes represent the reciprocal of the specific heat for ice, for liquid water, and for steam.","But heat also is required to change state, as is shown in the parts of the graph where the slope is equal to zero, like in the areas labeled ice + water and water + steam.  You can see that the temperature stays constant there.  Also note that the amount of heat required for vaporization (water to steam, steam to water) is different than the amount of heat required for fusion (ice to water, water to ice).","The second graph shows the heating curve for one kilogram of lead. It differs from the first graph, since lead has different properties than water.  For instance, the latent heats of lead are 2.45\u00d710<sup class=\"\">4<\/sup> J\/kg for fusion and 8.70\u00d710<sup class=\"\">5<\/sup> J\/kg for vaporization.","Again, the slope is the reciprocal of the specific heat for each of the three states.  The slopes for lead and for water are different, which reflects the fact they have different specific heats.  "],"objNames":["wb_heat_temperature_phase1","wb_heat_temperature_phase2"]}
