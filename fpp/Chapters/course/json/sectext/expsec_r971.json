Only a section of each wave front can pass through the opening. After passing through the opening, the wave front begins to expand. This expansion is known as diffraction.  ","Diffraction explains why you can hear sound through a doorway even when you are not standing directly in front of it. The woman shown can hear the sound because the sound waves diffract. If diffraction did not occur, she would be able to hear the sound only if she were standing in the gray rectangular region shown in the diagram. "],"objNames":["wb_diffraction_light_concepts"]}
