","The second law of thermodynamics is “tougher” than simply applying the law of conservation of energy − it says that less than 100% of the energy entering as heat can be converted into work. ","The law of conservation of energy does apply − the energy does not disappear.  In our heat engine model, we show some energy escaping as heat into the cold reservoir.  That energy does not do work, and since the work done is less than the energy supplied to the engine, the engine is less than 100% efficient.","We write the second law as an inequality in this section. The second law says that work done by an engine is less than the heat supplied to it. ","Efficiency equals work divided by heat supplied.  Since work is less than heat, the second law requires that all engines are less than 100% efficient.  Bummer! "],"objNames":["wb_second_law_concepts","wb_second_law_efficiency_concepts"]}
