    "Sounds are so common that it is easy to take them for granted. When you think of sound, you may think of your favorite song. To a physicist, though, a song is a mechanical longitudinal wave consisting of regions of high and low pressure. ",
    "You begin your study of sound by experimenting with a simulation of a loudspeaker. One column of particles is colored red to emphasize that they just move back and forth, and over time do not make any forward progress. ",
    "Press GO to send a sound wave through the air. You will see the loudspeaker’s diaphragm vibrate horizontally. This causes the nearby air particles to oscillate, and as they interact with their neighbors, a wave is formed.",
    "Observe the differences between this wave and the <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_transverse_wave_concept'>transverse waves</a> you saw in strings. You should be able to see how in this <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_longitudinal_wave_concept'>longitudinal wave</a>, the particles of the medium (air) oscillate parallel to the direction the wave travels, as opposed to the transverse wave, where the particles oscillated perpendicular to the direction of the wave’s travel.",
    "The simulation lets you control the loudspeaker to determine the amplitude and frequency of the wave. You can observe how the wavelength changes when you alter the frequency."
