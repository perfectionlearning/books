We dedicate a few sections to how early scientists determined that value. Many early scientists, such as René Descartes, thought the speed of light was infinite. Given that it moves at about 671 million miles per hour, it is easy to understand why they believed it moved at infinite speed.","Rather than accepting beliefs without proof, Galileo attempted to measure the speed of light. He had an assistant stand on a hill about a mile away with a light. Galileo flashed his light, and when his assistant saw the flash, he would immediately flash his light back. ","Galileo measured when he saw the returning flash. It was a simple but clever experiment, doomed to failure because of the lack of sophisticated equipment and the vast speed of light. ","The problem Galileo faced: If you divide the two-mile round-trip of light by the speed of light, it is clear that Galileo and his assistant lacked the reflexes, and timing equipment, to work with such a short time interval. Some quick math indicates the time interval would be about a hundred-thousandth of a second. "],"objNames":["wb_light_speed1"]}
