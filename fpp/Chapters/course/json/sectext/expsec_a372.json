We show how this number can be written in scientific notation as 6.38\u00d710<sup class=\"\">6<\/sup> meters. Writing it this way makes for fewer errors and less paper consumption. We can also write 6.38\u00d710<sup class=\"\">6<\/sup> as 6.38e6.  \u201ce\u201d is equivalent to \u00d710 raised to the power of the number following the \u201ce\u201d.  ","Every number written in scientific notation starts with a leading value. Here, the leading value is 6.38. ","The leading value must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10. The leading value is multiplied by another value. Scientific notation uses the multiplication symbol that looks like an \u00d7.","The leading value is multiplied by a power of 10. In the example, we multiply 6.38 by 10<sup class=\"\">6<\/sup>. ","To calculate the value of 6.38\u00d710<sup class=\"\">6<\/sup>, we write 10<sup class=\"\">6<\/sup> in its expanded form.
