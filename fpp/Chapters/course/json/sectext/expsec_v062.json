Others are unstable \u2212 either impossible to achieve or destined to last only a short period of time. What determines which combinations of protons and neutrons are possible within a nucleus and which are not?  For example, is it possible to have a silver atom with 47 protons and no neutrons? ","Only certain combinations of neutron number and atomic number will result in stable nuclei. The atomic number is the number of protons in an element\u2019s nucleus, and the mass number is the sum of the number of neutrons and protons in a nucleus. You see two stable nuclei in the upper diagram. Deuterium is an isotope of hydrogen, with one proton and one neutron. The most common form of aluminum, which is stable with a mass number of 27, has thirteen protons and fourteen neutrons in its nucleus. ","The nuclei shown in the lower diagram are not stable. The isotope of hydrogen with one proton and three neutrons is very unstable and can exist only for an instant. The same is true for the cobalt isotope that we show, which has twenty-seven protons and no neutrons.  ","As you may suspect, the relationship of the number of protons to the number of neutrons is the crucial factor. "],"objNames":["wb_stable_nuclei_concepts","wb_unstable_concepts"]}
