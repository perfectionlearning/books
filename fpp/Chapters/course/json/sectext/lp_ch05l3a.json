[OBJ:expsec_e763:Newton's third law] states that every force creates an equal but opposite force acting against it.<br />2. [OBJ:expsec_e764:Weight] is defined as the force of gravity acting on an object. Weight is equal to mass multiplied by freefall acceleration. [OBJ:expsec_e765:Weight] depends on the freefall acceleration experienced by the mass.<br />3. The [OBJ:expsec_e766:normal force] occurs when two objects are in direct contact. The direction of the normal force is always perpendicular to the contact surface.<br />4. [OBJ:expsec_e767:Tension] is the force on an object by a string, cord, rope, or chain. Tension acts in the direction that the string, cord, rope, or chain is being pulled.<br />5. [OBJ:expsec_e768:Friction] is the force that acts opposite an object sliding on top of a surface. [OBJ:wb_kinetic_friction_definition:Kinetic friction] is the friction of a moving object sliding on top of a surface. [OBJ:wb_static_friction_definition:Static friction] occurs when a force is being applied to accelerate an object, but the object is not moving.","  <b>Vocabulary:</b>  [OBJ:expsec_e763:Newton's third law], action-reaction pair, [OBJ:expsec_e764:weight], [OBJ:expsec_e766:normal force], [OBJ:expsec_e767:tension], [OBJ:expsec_e768:friction], [OBJ:expsec_e770:static friction], [OBJ:expsec_e770:kinetic friction]","  <b>STEM Skills:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1.
