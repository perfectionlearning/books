For instance, one model of container farms requires about 100 kWh of power a day.","There are several reasons to consider solar power as the energy source. One, is the cultural desire for independence âˆ’ there is no need to tie into a central electrical grid.  Two, electricity is expensive, especially in remote locations.  Three, solar power does not emit carbon dioxide, addressing an environmental concern.  Finally, safety: The solar power grid has no moving parts, so they do not pose the same safety concerns as a generator.","The priority of using solar power will vary based on the goals of the farmer.  For some, hydroponic farming is part of a green future, and solar power is an important part of that future.  It may also be an important part of the social desire for self-reliance. In remote locations, the lack of a connection to the electrical grid may be a constraint that requires solar or another off-the-grid energy solution.","For others, hydroponic farming may be a cost-effective way to farm, and solar power will be a lower priority. The initial investment for solar power may also be a constraint for some.  Safety typically is a minor concern. "],"objNames":["wb_solar_hydro1"]}
