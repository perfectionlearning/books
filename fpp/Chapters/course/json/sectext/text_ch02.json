Classify relationships as proportional, linear, inversely proportional, and nonlinear.<br />2. Identify and calculate rates in graphs.<br />3. Identify the <i>x</i>- and <i>y</i>-axes, and analyze slope in a position-time graph.<br />4. Analyze a position-time graph for velocity and acceleration.<br />5. Create scatter plots and draw trend lines.<br />6. Analyze scatter plots and trend lines using standard deviation and regression.<br />7. Freefall acceleration is a constant value, but it has different values depending on your location in the universe.<br />8. Reference frames are different for each observer.<br />9. Relative velocity can be calculated based on the velocities observed in the reference frame of each observer.","  <b>Vocabulary:</b> freefall acceleration, inversely proportional, linear regression, linear relationship, nonlinear, position-time graphs, proportional, rate, reference frame, relationship, relative velocity scatter plot, standard deviation, trend line ","  <b>STEM Skills:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1.

For an explanation of how to incorporate Science Notebooks into your instruction, see Chapter 1 Overview, Part 1.","  <b>Write a News Report</b> Have students imagine that they are news reporters in 1971. Their assignment is to write a short news report on the hammer and feather demonstration done on the Apollo 15 mission.  Be sure they include an explanation of how Galileoâ€™s work led to the demonstration. "],"objNames":[]}
