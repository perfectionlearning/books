In the animation, we shift the viewpoint so you see that the ball is moving in uniform circular motion, at a constant speed around a circle. An object moving in uniform circular motion viewed from the edge appears to be in simple harmonic motion.","Galileo used this relationship to demonstrate that the bodies he saw near Jupiter were in fact moons orbiting the planet. They were moving in approximately circular orbits around the planet, and from Earth, where their orbits were viewed on edge, their motion appeared as simple harmonic motion along a line. This was a demonstration that not all astronomical bodies orbit Earth."],"objNames":["wb_SHM_uniform_circular"]}
