","Kepler demonstrated that all planets have elliptical orbits. For example, we show that Mars’ orbit around the Sun has an elliptical shape. This is his first law, and it applies to satellites, including Earth, orbiting any massive central body, such as the Sun. It applies equally well to the Moon orbiting the Earth.","Kepler observed that the Sun is located at one focus of every planetary orbit. A focus is one of two points that defines an ellipse.  A circle is an ellipse in which the two focal points coincide, so Kepler’s law applies to circular orbits as well. "],"objNames":["wb_kepler_first_law1","wb_kepler_first_law"]}
