The actual value varies slightly around the globe, for several reasons. ","What are the reasons the value for <i>g</i> varies? One is that it depends on how far a point is from Earth’s center. For instance, the summit of Mt. Everest in Nepal is 8,850 meters above sea level, which means it is 8,850 meters farther from Earth’s center than a point at sea level. This altitude difference means <i>g</i> is 0.03 m/s<sup class=\"\">2</sup> less at the peak of Everest than it is at sea level.","The value for <i>g</i> also varies because Earth is not a perfect sphere. It has a gut, bulging slightly at the equator. We exaggerate this effect in the second diagram. Objects at the equator are farther from Earth’s center than objects at the North or South Poles. The groundhog, shown at the North Pole, experiences a slightly greater acceleration due to gravity than he would at the equator. ","Freefall acceleration also varies because mass is not distributed uniformly inside the Earth. An iron ore deposit is a denser part of Earth. For nearby objects, the higher concentration of mass causes greater force and greater acceleration due to gravity."],"objNames":["wb_g_on_Earth1","wb_g_on_Earth2"]}
