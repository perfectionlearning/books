The zero position is also called the origin. We show the car’s position on a number line at the top, with its value shown above the car.","Positions to the right of the origin are positive, as shown in the first diagram.  When you drive the car in activities, you will see positive numbers above the car when you are to the right of the origin.","When the car moves to the left of the origin, its position is negative, as shown in the second diagram.    Positions become increasingly negative the farther you move to the left of the origin.  Position requires a unit of length. The meter, abbreviated as “m,” is the standard unit of length in physics.","Position is represented with a variable such as “<i>x</i>.” The initial position, <i>x</i><sub class=\"\">i</sub>, is pronounced “<i>x</i> sub i.” The “i” is a subscripted letter, a letter that sits immediately below and to the right of another letter.  It stands for “initial,” which means “starting.” The final position, <i>x</i><sub class=\"\">f</sub>, is pronounced “x sub f.” The “f” stands for “final.”"],"objNames":["actwb_position_concept","actwb_position_equations"]}
