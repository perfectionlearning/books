The zero position is also called the origin. We show the car\u2019s position on a number line at the top, with its value shown above the car.","Positions to the right of the origin are positive, as shown in the first diagram.  When you drive the car in activities, you will see positive numbers above the car when you are to the right of the origin.","When the car moves to the left of the origin, its position is negative, as shown in the second diagram.    Positions become increasingly negative the farther you move to the left of the origin.  Position requires a unit of length.
