Conduction requires direct contact but does not involve the net movement of molecules.  Convection is thermal energy transferred through the motion of particles.  And radiation requires, well, electromagnetic radiation.","Electromagnetic radiation includes sunlight and the radiation used in microwave ovens. If you sit outside on a sunny day and feel warmer: Your thermal energy has been increased by sunlight, a form of electromagnetic radiation.  ","Microwave ovens provide another example of using electromagnetic radiation to increase somethingâ€™s thermal energy. ","The amount of radiation, and its wavelength, can be used for medical purposes. You see a photograph that records the infrared radiation a horse emits.","This photo was taken using a system that makes infrared radiation visible to us. The yellow and red areas show that the ears and mouth emit the most infrared energy. A warmer area may indicate an area that is strained.
