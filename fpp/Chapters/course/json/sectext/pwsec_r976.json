It does this by limiting the circuit density \u2212 how close circuits can be placed to one another. Designers want circuits closer to one another so that they can supply more computing power, or more memory capacity, in the same size component.  Denser circuits can also consume less power. ","What role does diffraction play in circuit density? Electromagnetic radiation, which includes light, diffracts after it passes through openings in the mask, which makes the transferred pattern larger than the openings in the mask. You see this happening here as radiation passes through one slit in the mask. ","As engineers design chips with greater circuit density, the circuits must be placed closer together. How close those circuits can be placed is limited in part by the diffraction of the radiation as it passes through the mask."],"objNames":["wb_computer_chips_concepts3"]}
