The <a class='pjumpToTopic' href='javascript:void(0)' data-chap='12' data-topic='5' data-subtopic='1' data-subsection='0'>efficiency</a> of engine cycles can be calculated by taking ratios using either work, heat in and heat out, or temperature of the hot and cold reservoirs.<br />2. The <a class='pjumpToTopic' href='javascript:void(0)' data-chap='12' data-topic='5' data-subtopic='2' data-subsection='0'>second law of thermodynamics</a> states that engines cannot be 100% efficient. Real-world engines lose heat to the environment during an engine cycle, so not all heat goes to doing work. Heat flows spontaneously from hotter environments to colder environments. Heat does not flow spontaneously from colder environments to hotter environments.",
