To calculate the average kinetic energy of a molecule, multiply Boltzmann's constant, by the temperature of the gas in Kelvins, by 3/2.<br />2. Since there are so many atoms that compose an amount of gas, we use the average velocity to approximate the speed of the molecules in the gas. To find the average velocity of molecules in a gas, take the [OBJ:expsec_ps18:root-mean-square].","  <b>Vocabulary:</b>  [OBJ:expsec_ps18:root-mean-square]","  <b>STEM Skills:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1.
