The first diagram shows the forces acting upon the monkey: the tension forces of the two ropes, and the force of gravity. ","As before, we draw all the forces as though they were acting on the origin, and we show only the forces acting on the monkey.  ","We can use the diagram to help to interpret the situation.  For instance, the two tension forces both have a horizontal component, and these components oppose one another. The diagram can help you move to the next steps: analyzing the object to find the net force, and calculating any acceleration. "],"objNames":["wb_multiple_bodies_one_object2","wb_free_body_concept1"]}
