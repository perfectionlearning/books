He proposed an alternate hypothesis that seemed hard to accept at the time.  There were particles, called neutrinos for “little neutral ones,” that had practically no rest mass, only energy and momentum, and a neutrino was emitted as part of the radiation process. (In the process of negative beta radiation, neutrons actually decay in part into antineutrinos, but Pauli called it a neutrino, since antiparticles were not understood at that point.) The hard-to-detect particles could account for the “missing” energy. ","Even Pauli was not sure his hypothesis was correct.  He did not present it publicly for three years and did not publish it in a scientific journal for a year after that.  Although he was not sure his hypothesis was correct, it could (and eventually did) save the law of conservation of energy."],"objNames":["wb_troublesome_data_3"]}
