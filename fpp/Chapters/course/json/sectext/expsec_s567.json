A bit is a number that is either one or zero.  The information is binary: it has two possible states. You can think of it as similar to yes or no, or true or false.  ","A byte is a group of bits, typically 8 bits.  We show a possible byte in the diagram, where each bit is a one or a zero.  This byte can be one of 256 possible numbers, depending on whether each bit is a one or a zero. ","Computer storage capacity is often measured in bytes, such as a 500 gigabyte hard drive. That is 500 billion bytes of information.","More bits are better when it comes to showing more precise information. The lower spectrum in the lower diagram shows a typical color palette for one byte of information âˆ’ 256 colors.  ","The upper spectrum displays the number of colors from 24 bits, which is 16,777,216 colors.  This makes for lifelike photographs, more exciting video games, and so on."],"objNames":["wb_digital_bits","wb_digital_bits2"]}
