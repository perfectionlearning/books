The prisms are stacked one atop the other, base to base. The prisms form a model for a converging lens, since such lenses are thickest at their centers.","The upper and lower rays of light refract as they enter and exit the prisms. This model of a converging lens brings the three rays to a common meeting point, known as a focus, or a focal point.","In the lower diagram, we take the same two prisms, but stack them tip to tip. Again, the light refracts, but this time it spreads out, or diverges. These two prisms form a model of a diverging lens. Diverging lenses are thinnest at their centers.","In this chapter, we focus on lenses that are spherical and thin. A spherical lens has two surfaces, each of which is a section of a sphere. Saying it is \u201cthin\u201d means the distance across a lens is small relative to the distance to the object that is the source of the image. Thin lenses provide an accurate model for optical equipment ranging from contact lenses to telescopes."],"objNames":["wb_lenses_concepts1","wb_lenses_concepts2"]}
