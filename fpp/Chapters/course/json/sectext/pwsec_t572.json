If you are not familiar with parabolas: They are curved, symmetrical shapes like you see in the upper diagram. A parabola can be mathematically described with a simple quadratic function.  Parabolic mirrors are commonly used in applications such as television satellite dishes.","Parabolic mirrors do not create aberrations − or imperfections − like spherical ones do. Any incident ray that is parallel to the principal axis, no matter how far it is from the axis, will reflect back precisely through the focal point.  ","Parabolic mirrors are common in telescopes. Radio wave reflectors, such as television satellite dishes, also take advantage of the focusing properties of a parabolic shape. The photograph shows a very large parabolic radio telescope dish.
