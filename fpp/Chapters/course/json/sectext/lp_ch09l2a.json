[OBJ:expsec_i957:Angular position] is calculated by measuring the arc length divided by the radius. It is measured in radians. Counterclockwise rotation is positive, while clockwise rotation is negative.<br />2. [OBJ:expsec_i958:Angular displacement] is the change in angular position. It is calculated by subtracting the initial angular position from the final angular position. It is measured in radians.<br />3. [OBJ:expsec_i959:Angular velocity] is the angular displacement per elapsed time. It is measured in radians per second.<br />4. The [OBJ:expsec_i960:angular acceleration] is the change in angular velocity per the elapsed time. It is measured in radians per second squared.","  <b>Vocabulary:</b>  [OBJ:expsec_i957:angular position], [OBJ:expsec_i958:angular displacement], [OBJ:expsec_i959:angular velocity], [OBJ:expsec_i960:angular acceleration]","  <b>STEM Skills:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1.
