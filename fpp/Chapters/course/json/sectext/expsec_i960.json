The increasing angular displacement between images captured at equal time intervals shows the angular acceleration. Angular acceleration measures the train\u2019s change in angular velocity per unit time, just as linear acceleration measures the rate of change of linear velocity.","We show the equation for an average or constant angular acceleration.
