The basic concepts of hypotheses and a reliance on empirical evidence prove useful. The same skills can be used for careers in health fields such as medicine and veterinary science.","There are also many fields in which physics is applied.  Physicists work in medicine in areas such as medical imaging and lasers.  They work in acoustics to design speakers, or auditoriums.  In materials science, they may apply their skills to semiconductors or to superconducting materials.  In sum, a physics background can be applied to a wide range of fields."],"objNames":["wb_physicists_and_you"]}
