A freely falling object in a vacuum accelerates toward the ground at this rate.","The legend is that a long time ago, Galileo Galilei supposedly dropped some balls off the Leaning Tower of Pisa.  He observed that different sized balls, or balls with different masses, landed at the same time.  Galileo created the conceptual model that freefall acceleration is the same for objects of any mass.","The symbol <i>g<\/i> represents the magnitude of freefall acceleration. Near the Earth\u2019s surface, <i>g<\/i> equals about <span class=\"math\">9.81 m\/s<sup>2<\/sup>.<\/span>  On other bodies, the acceleration varies, with objects having greater acceleration on the planet Jupiter, which is more massive than Earth, and smaller acceleration on the Moon, which is less massive than Earth.
