{"cards":[{"lines":[{"type":"title","text":"Circular orbit speed"}]}],"definitions":[],"secText":["In this simulation, you are the pilot of an orbiting spacecraft, and your mission is to dock with a space station. Your ship is initially orbiting in the same circular orbit as the space station. ","In order to dock, your ship must be in the same orbit as the space station, and it must touch the space station. To dock, your speed and radius must be very close to that of the space station. A high-speed collision does not count as a successful docking event!","You have two buttons to control your ship. The “Forward thrust” button fires rockets out the back of the ship, accelerating your spacecraft in the direction of its current motion. The other button, labeled “Reverse thrust,” fires retrorockets in the opposite direction.","This activity requires no mathematical calculations, but some thought and experimentation are necessary.
