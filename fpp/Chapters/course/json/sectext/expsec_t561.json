","The light reflects at the boundary. The perpendicular line you see in the diagram is called a normal line. It is used to define the angles. ","The angle of reflection is the angle between the reflected ray and the normal line. The law of reflection states that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. ","To stress a point: the angles of incidence and reflection are defined by reference to a line normal (perpendicular) to the mirror. The normal line is shown as a dashed line in the diagram. In the upper illustration, we show the angles of incidence and reflection, along with the normal line that is used to define them. ","The equation states the law of reflection mathematically: The angles of incidence and reflection, both measured from the normal line, are equal.
