","Dark matter is matter that cannot be seen since it does not emit light. It is estimated to make up about 22% of the matter and energy, including dark energy, of the Universe.  ","Scientists first began to suspect  its existence in 1933, when astronomical observations and calculations of gravitational effects revealed that there must be more “stuff” present in the Universe than could be observed in telescopes. Astronomers discovered that the motion of stars and other bodies could not be explained solely by the mass visible to astronomers.   ","Although the existence of dark matter is accepted among most scientists, what it is made of is still up for debate. One theory proposes that it is made up of particles symmetric to those that make up the Standard Model.  "],"objNames":["wb_dark_matter_concepts"]}
