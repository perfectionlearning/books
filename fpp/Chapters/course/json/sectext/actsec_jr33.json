    "The simulations allow you to experiment with electric potential energy. Just as a configuration of masses, such as a barbell held above Earthâ€™s surface, possesses gravitational potential energy, so too does a configuration of electrically charged particles possess electric potential energy.",
    "The simulation contains a stationary positive charge (red) and a positive test charge (white) that you drag around with your mouse. The potential energy, which depends on the distance <i>r</i> between the charges and their amounts, is displayed in the control panel. A graph of the <i>PE</i> is drawn on the right side of the simulation as you move the test charge around. Each particle has a charge of one microcoulomb. ",
    "As with gravitational potential energy, a configuration having zero potential energy must be defined. The potential energy is defined to be zero when an infinite distance separates the two charges.",
    "As you move the test charge, consider the following questions: What is the sign of the <i>PE</i>? When is the potential energy the greatest? The least? The graph shows <i>PE</i> as a function of the distance <i>r</i> between the charges.",
    "The second simulation is the same as the first, except the charges have opposite signs.  What is similar between the electric potential energy of this system versus the first?  What is different?"
