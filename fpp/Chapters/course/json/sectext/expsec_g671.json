We use X\u2019s to locate the center of mass of the system at regular intervals of time. Although the balls move at different velocities before and after the collision, the center of mass of the system moves in a straight line at a constant velocity, because no net external force acts on the system. You can see this from the even spacing of the X marks indicating the center of mass. ","This result follows the principle of conservation of momentum \u2212 there is no net force on the system, so the system\u2019s momentum stays constant. The system behaves as if it is a single particle at the center of mass, moving with constant momentum, meaning constant velocity."],"objNames":["wb_center_of_mass_and_collisions"]}
