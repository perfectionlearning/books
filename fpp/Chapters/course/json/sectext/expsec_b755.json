For instance, the distance between the initial position of 40 meters and the final position of −200 meters is 240 meters.  ","A distance is always zero or positive, never negative.   ","The equation for distance is the absolute value of the difference between the final position and the initial position.  We write the equation both with variables and with words.  ","The vertical brackets mean “absolute value.”  If you subtract and get a negative number, then just drop the minus sign."],"objNames":["actwb_distance_concept","wb_distance_equation"]}
