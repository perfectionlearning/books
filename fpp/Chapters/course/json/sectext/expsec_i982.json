    "The <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_efficiency_concepts'>efficiency</a> of a machine equals the ratio of the work it does, or its output, divided by the work supplied, or the input.  A 100% efficient machine would convert all the work supplied to the work it does.  However, factors like friction and air resistance mean machines are less than 100% efficient.",
