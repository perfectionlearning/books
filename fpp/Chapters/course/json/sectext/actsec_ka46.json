{"cards":[{"lines":[{"type":"title","text":"Set the direction and magnitude of the forces"}]}],"definitions":[],"secText":["The simulation will help you develop an understanding for how forces in different directions combine when applied to an object. The 5.0 kg ball has two forces acting on it, <b>F</b><sub class=\"\">1</sub> and <b>F</b><sub class=\"\">2</sub>. ","In the simulation, you set a force vector’s direction and magnitude by dragging its arrowhead. You will notice the angles are restricted to multiples of 90°. For finer control, you can also adjust the magnitude of each vector in the control panel. You can check the box “Display vectors head to tail” if you would like to see them graphically combined in that fashion.","Here are some challenges for you. First, set the forces so that the ball does not move at all when you press GO. The forces must be at least 10 newtons each, so setting them both to zero is not an option!","Next, hit each of the three targets. The first target is directly to the right of the ball’s initial position, and the second is at a 45° angle from the ball’s starting position.  The third target is at a 150° angle. We allow for rounding to the nearest integer with this “extra-credit” target. "],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_6_0"]}
