They typically create energy from complex chemical reactions.  ","Like all devices, batteries are not \u201cideal\u201d but lose some of their emf over time \u2212 something you note every time you recharge a cell phone. Batteries also are a source of resistance in a circuit, which is called a battery\u2019s internal resistance.  ","Batteries are often described as the \u201cenergy pump\u201d in a circuit.  They raise the energy of the electrons, just like a pump could raise the gravitational potential energy of water.","Batteries have two terminals \u2212 connection points with different electric potential. One terminal is positively charged and the other is negatively charged. The potential difference of the battery, often called the voltage or emf, is the potential difference between the two terminals. ","For instance, an AAA battery supplies 1.5 volts, while a typical car battery operates at 12 volts. The voltage is the potential difference between them.","Batteries also differ by how much energy they can supply over their lifetimes.  Both AAA and D batteries supply 1.5 volts, but the larger D batteries last longer.  "],"objNames":["wb_batteries1","wb_batteries2"]}
