    "The theoretical idea and the later discovery of evidence of the strong and weak forces were two major physics accomplishments of the past 100 years. The observation of radioactivity required an explanation, and their properties met the requirements. ",
    "Alpha radiation can be partially explained by the strong force. Evidence for the existence of the strong force was provided by the observed existence and stability of the alpha particle. The electric repulsion between the two protons would be expected to tear the alpha particle apart, so there must exist a force, even stronger than the electromagnetic force, that holds the protons and neutrons together.  ",
    "  <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_fission_concepts1'>Nuclear fission</a> also provides evidence about the strong nuclear force. Experiments show that although the strong force is strong enough to keep relatively small nuclei together, its range is very limited, and larger, more massive nuclei tend to break apart."
