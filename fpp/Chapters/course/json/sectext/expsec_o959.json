","The disks we show in the first diagram are electrically neutral, since they have equal numbers of electrons and protons. Each disk has three electrons and three protons, so the negative and positive charges balance each other. There is no net electric charge on either disk. Each is electrically neutral. ","In the second illustration, we show how neutral objects become charged. When an electron moves from the right disk to the left one, it causes both disks to become charged. The disk on the left then has four electrons and three protons. Something with more electrons than protons is negatively charged. The one excess electron means the disk on the left has a charge of −1.60×10<sup class=\"\">−19</sup> C.","The  disk on the right, labeled as positive, is home to two electrons and three protons. Since protons are positively charged, the disk has a positive net charge: +1.60×10<sup class=\"\">−19</sup> C."],"objNames":["wb_creating_charged__concepts1","wb_creating_charged__concepts"]}
