Instantaneous velocity is the velocity at a moment, an instant, in time.  It is the displacement divided by a very small amount of elapsed time \u2212 the smaller, the better. The velocity gauge and the velocity arrow above the number line show the instantaneous velocity, and update as the car's velocity changes.  ","Instantaneous velocity can be positive, negative, or zero.  When we paused the simulation at 38.27 seconds to create the top image, the car's instantaneous velocity was negative 30 meters per second.  ","To contrast instantaneous and average velocity, let\u2019s calculate the car\u2019s average velocity during its trip. During the 38.27 seconds the trip required, the car had a displacement of 390 meters.  Its average velocity is approximately positive 10 meters per second.  This scenario shows the difference: The car has a negative instantaneous velocity, while its average velocity is positive.","The equation for instantaneous velocity is the same as the equation for velocity \u2212 except the amount of time is said to be \u201cvery small.\u201d  A tenth of a second, a thousandth of a second:  the smaller the better."],"objNames":["actwb_instantaneous_velocity_definition","wb_instantaneous_velocity_equation"]}
