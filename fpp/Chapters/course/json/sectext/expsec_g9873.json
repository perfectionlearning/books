We have created a table of data and graphed it.  The graph is called a scatter plot.","Each row of data is an ordered pair.  Here, the row consists of time and speed. ","The word correlation is used to describe the relationship between two variables, such as the length of a sample and the temperature. The trend line in the graph has a positive slope, rising from left to right. This positive correlation means that the measured length increases with temperature.","Relative humidity tends to decrease as the temperature increases. That trend line would have a negative slope, falling from left to right. The linear correlation is negative.","If we create a scatter plot of house number plotted against hours of exercise, we\u2019ll likely find that no single line passes near all the points, and there is no linear correlation. This is not too surprising: There is no reason to think that street number has a relationship to exercise.  "],"objNames":["wb_scatterplot","wb_correlation"]}
