In a branch of physics known as geometrical optics, they are used to predict the properties of images, such as location and size. Light rays are used to analyze both mirrors and lenses.","A light ray is a representation of light as a straight line. You see rays of light starting at a penguin\u2019s foot and heading off in several directions. An arrow indicates the direction of each light ray.","In the illustration, one light ray is used to demonstrate how the penguin can see his foot in the mirror. The ray starts at the foot, reflects off the mirror, and goes to his eye. "],"objNames":["wb_light_rays_concepts"]}
