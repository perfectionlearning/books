Another way to express the second law is to say that heat only flows spontaneously from hot to cold. It requires work to cause it to flow in the other direction. The second law tells us that a cold quart of ice cream in a hot car always absorbs heat from the car. The ice cream never becomes colder and the car warmer. ","Heat can be forced to flow from cold to hot: It just takes work to do so.  It does not flow in that direction spontaneously. A refrigerator is an example where work is done on a system (the refrigerator), causing heat to leave a colder environment (the refrigeratorâ€™s interior) and move to a warmer one (the kitchen). As the electrical cord on a refrigerator indicates, it requires external energy to cause this to happen."],"objNames":["wb_heat_flow_direction_concepts","wb_heat_flow_direction_concepts2"]}
