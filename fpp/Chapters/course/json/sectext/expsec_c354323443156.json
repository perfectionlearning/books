In particular, we will discuss how this relates to the physical properties of metals and nonmetals. As with most statements about the periodic table, these are general guidelines, and there are exceptions.","In a metallic bond, an atom contributes the electrons in its outer shell, along with many other atoms, to form bonds, forming a kind of electron soup or sea.  In metals, the valence electrons are not tightly bound to the nucleus. This kind of bond is difficult to break but does not have a strong orientation in terms of direction. This means metal atoms slip by one another easily, explaining why metals are malleable, and can be stretched and formed.  A gold ring is an example of a material with these properties. ","This form of bonding means metals are good conductors, because the electrons are loosely bound and move freely when an electric potential difference is applied.  Nonmetals, when they bond together, will be poor conductors. ","Nonmetallic elements can bond together by forming covalent bonds.   (With covalent bonds, atoms “share” electrons.) Materials covalently bonded together often, but not always, also have relatively low melting and boiling points. Covalently bonded materials tend to be softer or “squishier.”  ","They tend to be joined with weak intermolecular forces which allows them to more readily pull apart.  ","In contrast, if the bonds were ionic (as in NaCl), then typically the bond itself would have to break, and that requires more energy. "],"objNames":["wb_periodictablephysicalproperties_1"]}
