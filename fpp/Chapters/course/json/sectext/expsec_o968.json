(The force can also be called the electrostatic force, because it occurs between static, which is to say stationary charges.)

Both the wrench and the balloon are electrically charged, but with opposite sign. Their charges cause the two objects to attract each other. The force pulling the objects together is an electric force.","In the image on the right in the upper diagram, we show two charged balloons. They have the same sign of charge. When the balloons are released, they drift apart due to a repulsive electric force between them. The electrical force can attract and repel, unlike gravity, which only attracts.","Objects with different charges, one positive and the other negative, attract each other.  This is often stated as \u201copposites attract.\u201d","Just as opposites attract, the electric force between <b>like<\/b> charges is a repulsive force between them. Two positively charged objects repel each other.  Similarly, two negatively charged objects repel each other. A charged particle applies no electric force on an uncharged particle.
