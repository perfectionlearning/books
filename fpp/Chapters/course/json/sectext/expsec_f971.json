    "Gravitational potential energy equals the product of mass, <i>g</i>, and height.     ",
    "The height has to be measured relative to a reference height.  It might be the surface of  Earth.  Or, in the classic physics experiment of rolling a ball down a plane, it might be the height above a tableâ€™s surface. ",
    "The reference height you choose defines a height of zero meters, and anything above that will have positive height.  This means a system can have zero potential energy, or it would have negative potential energy if it is lower than the reference height. ",
    "In general, the work done on a system changes its energy. Here, we focus on its impact on gravitational <i>PE</i>.  If you lift the bucket, your work goes to changing the gravitational potential energy of the bucket-Earth system.",
    "The equation, <i>mgh</i>, reflects the work done lifting the object if it starts and ends at rest, and it is also the change in gravitational <i>PE</i>. Why? The work you did in lifting equals the product of your force (<i>mg</i>, opposing the weight) and the displacement, <i>h</i>."
