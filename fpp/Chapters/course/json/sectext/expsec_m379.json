A single up-and-down motion on the string caused the pulse. ","Periodic waves have a repeating pattern.  In the lower diagram, this is caused by a hand shaking a string up and down.  The wave travels to the right, and a particle in the string shakes up and down.  The waves we typically study have particles that move in simple harmonic motion.
