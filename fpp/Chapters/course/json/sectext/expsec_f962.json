A rolling ball, a plane passing overhead, the atoms vibrating in a molecule: All have kinetic energy.  They may simultaneously have other forms of energy \u2212 an object does not exclusively possess one type of energy.  But if an object is moving, it has kinetic energy. ","Kinetic energy is proportional to the mass of an object. A train locomotive that is moving quickly has more kinetic energy than an identical locomotive that is moving slowly.","Kinetic energy is also proportional to the square of an object\u2019s speed. If the locomotive is moving faster than the caterpillar, then that is another reason it has more kinetic energy.","To compute a specific example: A 747 airplane at its cruising speed has about 300 billion times more kinetic energy than a ping-pong ball flying across a table.","A last note: energy, including kinetic energy, has no direction.  It is a scalar. Whether the plane is moving left or right, only its speed matters when computing its kinetic energy.","Kinetic energy, abbreviated <i>KE<\/i>, equals one-half times the mass of an object times the square of its speed.  The unit of energy, like that of work, is the joule."],"objNames":["wb_kinetic_energy_definition","wb_kinetic_energy_equation"]}
