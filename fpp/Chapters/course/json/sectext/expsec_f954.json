","You may think of work as homework, or as something done to earn money.  But as is quite common, scientists have their own definition.","To a scientist, work involves force and movement.  Work is sometimes defined as \u201cforce through a distance,\u201d though we prefer \u201cforce parallel to a displacement.\u201d  More precisely, it equals the product of the displacement and the component of that force parallel to the displacement.  If the force is parallel to the displacement, as with two examples we show in this section, then work equals the product of the displacement and the force. ","How does work relate to force and displacement? A greater amount of work is done when the force parallel to the displacement is greater.  For instance, if you lift a heavy weight, like the weightlifter we show, you are doing more work than if you lift a paper clip through the same displacement.  ","And the amount of work increases with displacement.  If you lift the weight 2 meters, you are doing more work on it than if you lift it 2 centimeters.
