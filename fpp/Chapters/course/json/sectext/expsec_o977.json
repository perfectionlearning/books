Fields provide the model for forces acting at a distance."}],"secText":["In this section, we start our discussion of electric fields by discussing the electric field at a point. To calculate the field at any point, we first calculate the force experienced   by a small, positive charge located at that point. ","The positive charge you see in the first diagram is called a test charge. It is weak enough that it does not change the field being studied.  ","The electric field is defined as the force per unit charge. The field can be measured at any point by placing a positive test charge there and measuring the amount of force the field applies on it, then dividing that amount by the test charge. The field\u2019s direction is the direction of the force it exerts on a <b>positive<\/b> test charge. The electric field vector is represented by <i>E<\/i>.","As the equation shows, the field strength <i>E <\/i>equals the amount of force <i>F<\/i> experienced by the test charge, divided by its magnitude <i>q<\/i>.  The direction of the field is the same as the force on a positive charge. The unit for electric field is newton per coulomb."],"objNames":["wb_efields_concepts","wb_efield_equation"]}
