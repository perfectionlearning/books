The photoelectric effect refers to the phenomenon that shining light on a metal surface can cause it to emit electrons. ","Classical wave theory could explain why light caused electrons to be emitted: Light being absorbed by the metal increases the energy of the material, allowing some electrons to escape their bonds to the surface. As scientists continued to observe this phenomenon, they observed some puzzling details.  ","It was the detailed behavior of the photoelectric effect that classical physics could not explain.  For instance, it could not explain the results of changing the intensity of the light.  The classical physicist expects that the higher-amplitude wave, the more intense light, would cause ejected electrons to move more quickly. You can conceive of this as being like an ocean wave: A more energetic wave will be taller, and when it collides with something like a boat, you’d expect it to propel the boat with greater energy. This does not happen."],"objNames":["wb_photoelectric1","wb_photoelectric2"]}
