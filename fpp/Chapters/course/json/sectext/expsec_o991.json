","The first illustration depicts two charges with opposite signs. This configuration of charges has electric potential energy.","It requires <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_work_concept'>work<\/a> to separate the charges. This work increases the system\u2019s potential energy. It is similar to lifting a rock off the ground \u2212 the greater the separation between the rock and the earth, the greater the <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_gravitational_PE_concept'>gravitational potential energy<\/a>.","The gravitational force always causes two masses to attract each other. In contrast, the electric force can cause both attraction and repulsion.  The reference point for zero electric potential energy is typically defined to be when charges are infinitely far apart.  If the charges have the same sign, their potential energy is increased when the charges are forced closer together.  ","If the charges have opposite signs, their electric potential energy is reduced when they get closer.  Since it starts as zero, this means it is always negative at any finite separation.  In sum, electric potential energy can be positive or negative."],"objNames":["wb_electric_potential_energy_concepts","wb_positive_positive"]}
