In the simulation, we are within femtometers of a proton, so the proton is appearing about “life-size” in the simulation and the diagram you see.   A femtometer is 10<sup class=\"\">−15</sup> of a meter, which is to say 10<sup class=\"\">−6</sup> nanometers, which is to say very, very small.  ","In the simulation, we drive a proton, or are in a proton vehicle, looking out the proton's windshield, as it were. ","The gauge shows the repulsive force in newtons.  As we drive closer and closer, the proton appears larger, of course, and the amount of force increases.    Later, you can drive in this simulation, and make your own force and distance calculations."],"objNames":["actwb_proton"]}
