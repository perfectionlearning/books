The balls all have the same mass. ","If one ball is pulled off and strikes the pack as shown, then one ball will fly off on the other side with the same velocity with which the first one hit the pack.     ","This means both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved.  Since kinetic energy is conserved, the collisions are elastic.","Interestingly, if you pick up two balls and release them, then two balls on the far side of the pack will fly off, resulting in a pattern of two balls moving. This pattern obeys the principle of the conservation of momentum as well as the definition of an elastic collision: kinetic energy remains constant. ","Other scenarios that on the surface might seem possible fail to meet both criteria. For instance, if one ball moved off the pack at twice the speed of the two balls striking, momentum would be conserved, but the <i>KE</i> of the system would increase, since <i>KE</i> is a function of the square of velocity. Doubling the velocity of one ball quadruples its <i>KE</i>. One ball leaving at twice the velocity would have twice the combined <i>KE</i> of the two balls that struck the pack."],"objNames":["wb_click_clack_balls"]}
