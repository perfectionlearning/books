    "We review the four fundamental forces, starting with gravitational and electromagnetic forces. The four forces describe the basic interactions in nature.  ",
    "One fundamental force is the <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_newton_equation_concept'>gravitational force</a>, the force that pulls Earth to the Sun, and the Sun to Earth. It is the force that attracts any two masses. ",
    "Charged particles exhibit the electromagnetic force.  The force exists between two charged particles or a charge moving in a magnetic field.  ",
    "Both gravity and the electromagnetic force coexist within the atom, but the electromagnetic force is far, far stronger than the force of gravity. The electromagnetic force between the electron and proton is about 10<sup class=\"\">40</sup> times stronger than the gravitational force.  To give a sense of the scale of that ratio, it is similar to the ratio of the size of the Universe to the size of a proton.  "
