","A wave\u2019s speed is constant in a given medium \u2212 like the speed of a wave in a particular string, a seismic wave moving through concrete, or sound traveling through air. Properties of the medium determine how fast the wave moves.  When a property is changed \u2212 such as the tension in the string or the temperature of air \u2212 then the speed of the wave changes.","Wave speeds vary greatly!  An electromagnetic wave such as light moves at, well, the speed of light \u2212 about 300,000,000 m\/s.   ","The speed of sound in air varies a bit based on factors like temperature and pressure, but 343 m\/s is a typical speed for sound in air.
