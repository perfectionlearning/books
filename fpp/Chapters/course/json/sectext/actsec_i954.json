    "The simulation on the left features the “Angular Surge,” an amusement park ride you will be asked to operate.  The ride has a rotating arm with a “rocket” where passengers sit. You can move the rocket closer to or farther from the center. You can also change the rocket’s period, the time it takes to make a complete revolution.",
    "By changing these properties, you will change the rocket’s angular velocity and its linear speed. The rocket’s angular velocity is the change per second in the angle of the ride’s arm. For instance, if the rocket completes one revolution in one second, its angular velocity is 2<i>π</i> radians (360°) per second. We discuss <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_math_solve_radian_measure'>radian measure</a> of angles more in a later section.",
    "What you should observe is this: How do changes in the period affect the angular velocity? the linear speed? And how does a change in the distance from the center (the radius of the rocket’s motion) affect those values, if at all? Can you determine how to maximize the linear speed of the rocket?"
