The seesaw we show in the diagrams obeys these conditions.  The conditions are no motion, no net force, and no net torque acting on the object. ","The seesaw is stationary, which means there is no net force acting on it. Why is this? There are no horizontal forces. The downward forces of the weights of the children are balanced by the upward normal force of the fulcrum, the triangle shape that supports the seesaw.","The seesaw is not rotating, which means there is no net torque acting on it. Why? Since the normal force of the fulcrum acts at the axis of rotation, it exerts no torque because the distance is zero. The negative (clockwise) torque on the seesaw applied by the boy is balanced by the positive (counterclockwise) torque due to the girl, which means they sum to zero. With no motion, no net force, and no net torque, the seesaw is in static equilibrium. "],"objNames":["wb_static_equilibrium_concept1","wb_static_equilibrium_concept2"]}
