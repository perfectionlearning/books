At any time, the motion has horizontal and vertical components. In the animation, you can see this as the velocity vector points in different directions as the passenger car circles the Ferris wheel.  The speed of the car is constant, as is shown with a constant-length velocity vector.  But the direction of the vector continuously changes, which means the passenger car is accelerating.","For instance, near the two o’clock position on the Ferris wheel, the passenger car is moving to the left and up, as the velocity vector arrow shows.  As it moves to 10 o’clock, the velocity vector points a bit to the left and down.  And near 7 o’clock, its motion is mostly to the right."],"objNames":["wb_circular_motion_concept"]}
