Here, we explain how to add vectors that point in any direction. ","To add vectors <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, we first move vector <b>B</b> so it starts at the head of vector <b>A</b>. You see the vector <b>B</b> “ghosted” as we slide it to its new location, with its tail at <b>A</b>’s head.","Then we connect the tail of the first vector to the head of the second. ","It may be helpful to imagine that these two vectors represent displacements. A person walks along displacement vector <span class=\"math\"><b>A,</b></span> and then along displacement vector <span class=\"math\"><b>B</b></span>. She starts at the origin, and she ends at the head of the <span class=\"math\"><b>A</b> + <b>B</b></span> vector.  "],"objNames":["wb_math_add_vectors_tail_to_tail"]}
