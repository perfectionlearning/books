We use acceleration as our example for determining what units we should expect.","The equation defines acceleration: It is the change in velocity divided by the elapsed time.  ","Velocity, and a change in velocity, is measured in length per unit time.  Time is already in the denominator of the entire fraction.  ","Simplifying the fraction, we get length divided by time squared.  ","An example of proper units for acceleration is meters per second squared.  Or another way to put it: the change in meters per second, each second. "],"objNames":["wb_math_solve_acceleration_units"]}
