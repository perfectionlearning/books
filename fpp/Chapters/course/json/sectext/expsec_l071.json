The gas starts in the same state as in Cycle 1. ","The first step in this cycle is the same as in the first cycle. The gas\u2019s pressure increases while its volume is held constant.","The gas expands and does positive work. It expands to the same volume as before, but the pressure also increases as more heat is added. ","The gas does positive work. It does more work than in the second step of the first cycle, because the pressure is greater. The gas expands the same amount as before, but with greater force because of the greater pressure.","As in Cycle 1, the gas is cooled, allowing the temperature and pressure to decrease. This occurs at a constant volume, so the gas does no work.","The gas is further cooled at a constant pressure, causing the volume to decrease. The gas does negative work as it contracts. The gas has returned to its initial state.","We show the net work done by the gas during each cycle. Note that the net work done by the engine is greater in Cycle 2 than in Cycle 1."],"objNames":["wb_work_depends_cycle_concepts2","wb_work_depends_cycle_concepts3"]}
