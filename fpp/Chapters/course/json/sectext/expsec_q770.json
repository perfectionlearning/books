In this section, we talk about the other required component, a commutator.","A commutator changes the direction of the current through the coil every half rotation. This changes the direction of the magnet created by the current. In the animation, we show the coil rotating, and once it reaches the point where it is parallel to the permanent field, inertia will cause it to continue to rotate a little farther. Just at this moment, the commutator reverses the current."," Because the <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_bfields_wires_concepts2'>direction of the current<\/a> determines the orientation of the magnetic field it creates, when the commutator changes the direction of the current flow, it causes the poles of the coil electromagnet to reverse. The torque now continues to cause the motor to rotate in the counterclockwise direction. This process repeats each half a revolution, causing the motor to continue to operate."],"objNames":["wb_electric_motor_concepts2"]}
