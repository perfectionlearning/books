{"cards":[{"lines":[{"type":"title","text":"Mass spectrometer"}]}],"definitions":[],"secText":["You will use this simulation of a mass spectrometer to determine what substance it is analyzing. You select a velocity, and the electric field fires a positive ion (charge +e) into a magnetic field. It will move along a circular path and strike a recording plate. The simulation displays radius of its path. You will use that information, the strength of the magnetic field (0.62 T), and the ion\u2019s speed to determine its mass.","In the simulation, you will see a drop-down list labeled \u201cSubstance is:\u201d It has a list of candidates for the mystery ion, complete with their masses. Determine the mass from your experiment, and then select from among the substances."],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_30_18"]}
