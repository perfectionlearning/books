","When a player kicks a ball at rest, she applies a force through a displacement.  She does positive work on the ball.  This work increases the ball\u2019s speed, and its kinetic energy increases. This is an example of the work-kinetic energy theorem. It shows the relationship between work done on an object, and the object\u2019s change in kinetic energy.","Then another player traps the ball.  She applies a force on the ball opposite to its displacement. That slows the ball down.  Moving more slowly means less kinetic energy.  This player\u2019s negative work on the ball reduces the ball\u2019s kinetic energy. ","The net work done on an object equals its change in kinetic energy.
