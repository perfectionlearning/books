    "Let’s see how work changes a soccer ball’s energy. ",
    "When a player kicks a ball at rest, she applies a force through a displacement.  She does positive work on the ball.  This work increases the ball’s speed, and its kinetic energy increases. This is an example of the work-kinetic energy theorem. It shows the relationship between work done on an object, and the object’s change in kinetic energy.",
    "Then another player traps the ball.  She applies a force on the ball opposite to its displacement. That slows the ball down.  Moving slower means less kinetic energy.  This player’s negative work reduces the ball’s kinetic energy. ",
    "The net work done on an object equals its change in kinetic energy. "
