In this chapter, we mostly discuss resonance in strings and in air, because of their relationship to musical instruments.  However, resonance can have a major impact in determining the effect of seismic waves − for example, the impact of an earthquake on a building is magnified if the waves resonate with its natural frequencies.  Resonance also determines the notes that a musical instrument plays.  ","Resonance describes a system that has a periodic driving force acting upon it, causing a large increase in its oscillation amplitude. The video shows a famous example of resonance, the Tacoma Narrows Bridge.  You can see that the bridge is moving as a wave, as it moves up and down. ","The collision of the wind with the bridge caused a driving frequency that was close to the natural frequency of the bridge. The wind effect was in resonance with the wave motion of the bridge.  It caused oscillations of increasing amplitude over time and collapsed the bridge.","Water waves in a sink or bathtub also provide a simple way to see and investigate a behavior of waves, resonance. ","Waves of certain frequencies are reinforced and amplified as they travel in a bathtub or sink based on factors such as the size and shape (dimensions) of the tank.  The amplitude of the standing wave increases when two waves overlap and a peak encounters another peak.  The amplitude would decrease when a peak meets a trough.
