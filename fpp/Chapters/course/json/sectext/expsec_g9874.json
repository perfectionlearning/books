First, we show the overall frequency table and then the conditional frequency table. ","The table confirms our conjecture that aluminum bars are more likely to crack.  The percentages change, with 38% of aluminum bars cracking instead of the 33% we had when we tested fewer bars. ","This is typical of surveys: Additional data can change results.  Here, it did not reveal any major trend, any overall change in the overall conclusion about the rate of aluminum versus steel cracking. In other cases, collecting more data can change the conclusion that is reached. "],"objNames":["wb_table_relationships_3"]}
