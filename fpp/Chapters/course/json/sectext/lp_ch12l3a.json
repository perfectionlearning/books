In the [OBJ:expsec_l062:first step of an engine cycle], heat flows into the system, causing the temperature and pressure of the system to increase, while the volume is constant. In the [OBJ:expsec_l062:second step] of an engine cycle, work is done by the system, causing the pressure and temperature of the system to decrease. Heat flows out of the system. In the [OBJ:expsec_l063:third step] of an engine cycle, work is done on the system, and the engine returns to its initial state.<br />2. In an [OBJ:expsec_l064:adiabatic process], there is no heat transfer into or out of the system. In an [OBJ:expsec_l065:isobaric process], pressure remains constant. In a [OBJ:expsec_l065:constant volume process], there is no work done by the system.","  <b>Vocabulary:</b>  [OBJ:expsec_l064:adiabatic], [OBJ:expsec_l065:isobaric]","  <b>STEM Skills:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1.
