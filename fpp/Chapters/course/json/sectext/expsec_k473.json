Heat is thermal energy that moves from one object to another.","When heat flows, it changes the thermal energy of an object.  This can be measured as a temperature change, or it can be a <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_phase_change_concepts'>change in state<\/a>, such as a liquid changing to a gas at a constant temperature. ","The letter <i>Q<\/i> represents heat. Because it is a form of energy, heat is measured in joules.","Heat flows spontaneously from warmer objects to cooler ones, just like an apple falls from a tree to the ground. By \u201cspontaneously,\u201d we mean without requiring work from outside the system.  For instance, we show how heat flows from the hot air of a summer day to the cold ice cream without any action required. ","Heat can be caused to move from something cooler to something warmer \u2212 a refrigerator is an example.  It takes a heat pump (and energy) to do the work for heat to flow from the cooler inside of a refrigerator to a warmer kitchen.   "],"objNames":["wb_heat_concepts1","wb_heat_concepts2"]}
