For the barbell in the first diagram, the center of mass is closer to the larger ball labeled \u201cWork\u201d because it is more massive.","For a symmetric object made from a uniformly dense material, the center of mass is located at its geometric center.  This means that for shapes with symmetry, such as spheres or cubes made of a single material, the center of mass is at the geometric center. Some examples include the objects shown in the second diagram, where the X marks the object\u2019s center of mass. "],"objNames":["wb_center_concept1","wb_center_concept2"]}
