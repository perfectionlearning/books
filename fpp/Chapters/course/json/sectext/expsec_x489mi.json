The state of the cat before opening the door is directly linked to the state of the radioactive material.  Quantum mechanics says that the cat is simultaneously in a state of being alive and in a state of being dead. But we believe from everyday experience that at any time, it must be either one or the other. A cat cannot be 50% alive . . . or can it? ","Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s thought experiment is parallel to specifying the state of a particle that has yet to be measured.  Its properties can only be described as probabilities.  ","Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s thought experiment also applies to what happens when a particle is observed.  Once the chamber is opened, the cat is either alive or dead, and the probabilities collapse and become an outcome. Similarly, even though we need to describe a particle\u2019s possible positions with probabilities, once observed, the broad probability density of the particle collapses to a specific value.
