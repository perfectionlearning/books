The amount of velocity of the puck is greatest at the equilibrium position because the spring has been pulling the puck toward the center, accelerating it, during the entire time it has been moving toward equilibrium from the endpoint. The puck continues moving beyond this point due to its momentum.","Note that \u201cequilibrium\u201d does not mean \u201cat rest.\u201d  The puck is moving at its fastest at equilibrium.  Equilibrium means there is no force.","As the puck continues its motion past equilibrium, the spring is compressed and it again exerts a restoring force. This force opposes the motion of the puck, slowing it down. ","The spring compresses until the puck stops momentarily. At this point, the force is again at its maximum amount, but opposite in direction from the force that started the motion. The puck reverses direction and moves toward equilibrium. When it reaches its initial point, the same cycle will begin again."],"objNames":["wb_SHM_speed"]}
