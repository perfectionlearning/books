Friction exists even between seemingly smooth surfaces. Although a surface may appear smooth, when magnified enough, any surface will look bumpy or rough. The magnified picture of the \u201csmooth\u201d crystal reveals its microscopic \u201crough\u201d texture.","Humans spend many resources to combat friction. For instance, friction within a motor is often a problem.  Motor oil, Teflon\u2122, WD-40\u2122, Tri-Flo\u2122 and many other products are designed to reduce this force. ","However, friction can be very useful. Without it, a nail would slip out of a board, the tires of a car would not be able to \u201cgrip\u201d the road, and you would not be able to walk. Many things, from rubber shoe soles to the crampons that climbers use, are signs that friction is required for humans to walk."],"objNames":["wb_friction_fun_facts2","wb_friction_fun_facts1"]}
