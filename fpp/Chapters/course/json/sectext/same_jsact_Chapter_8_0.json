{"cards":[{"lines":[{"type":"title","text":"Play with momentum"}]}],"definitions":[],"secText":["On the left is an activity that you can use to begin your study of conservation of momentum. You start by setting the initial velocity for both the blue and the red pucks and use these velocity settings to cause them to collide. ","The blue puck has a mass of <span class=\"math\">1.0\u00a0kg,<\/span> and the red puck has a mass of <span class=\"math\">2.0\u00a0kg<\/span>. There is no friction between the pucks and the shuffleboard. ","Using the activity, answer these questions. Does the collision of the pucks affect the sum of their velocities? In other words, does the sum of their velocities remain constant? Does the collision affect the sum of their momentums? Remember to consider positive and negative signs when summing these values. If the system\u2019s momentum is the same after the collision, the momentum was conserved. For an optional challenge: Does the collision conserve the total kinetic energy of the pucks? If so, the collision is called an elastic collision."],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_8_0"]}
