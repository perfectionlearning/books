","Virtual images appear on the side of the mirror opposite the object they are created from.  We perceive them as behind the mirror. The images are called virtual because no light rays actually come from, or pass through, the position of the image. Our brains place these images at their locations based on light rays reflecting from the front of the mirror. ","Real images are on the same side of the mirror as the object. The concave mirror we show in the lower diagram is creating a real image. "],"objNames":["wb_virtual_image_concepts","wb_real_image_concepts"]}
