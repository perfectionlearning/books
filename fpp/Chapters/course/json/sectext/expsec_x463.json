An atom is a nucleus surrounded by electrons orbiting only at certain radii and energy levels."}],"secText":["The physicist Niels Bohr extended Einstein’s concept of quantum physics, applying it first to the hydrogen atom.  He concluded that the electron in a hydrogen atom could only move about the nucleus in orbits of specific sizes. ","In other words, the orbits were quantized, not continuous, like the orbits of asteroids, or planets, around the Sun could be. Here we show some of the potential orbits with dashed lines, with the electron moving in one of the possible orbits. ","Bohr stated that the orbits were of fixed sizes, and that an electron remains in a given orbit unless it is acted upon by some outside influence. ","In our diagram, <i>n</i> = 1 is the orbit closest to the nucleus, and the orbital numbers increase with distance from the nucleus. These are the only possible orbits of a hydrogen atom’s electron.  Loosely speaking, an electron cannot exist in the regions between these orbits.   (Note: The radii are not drawn to scale − it would be difficult to clearly show them if they were.) "],"objNames":["wb_bohr1"]}
