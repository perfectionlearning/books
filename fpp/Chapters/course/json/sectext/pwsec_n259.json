In the picture, the plane is passing its own sound waves, leaving a conical wake of sound.  ","The sound waves pile up on one another in front of the moving object.","The cone of sound waves behind the speeding object is called a Mach cone. The surface of the Mach cone is called a shock wave.  Supersonic jets or rockets produce shock waves, which in turn create sounds called sonic booms.  A rapid change in air pressure causes the sonic boom. ","You may have heard other sonic booms, such as the report of a rifle or the crack of a well-snapped whip. The boom indicates that the bullet or the tip of the whip is moving faster than the speed of sound. The example of the whip shows that the moving object can be silent and still create a shock wave."],"objNames":["wb_supersonic_concepts2"]}
