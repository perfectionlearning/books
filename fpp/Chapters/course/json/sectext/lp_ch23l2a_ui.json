The more intense the light is that strikes the material correlates to an increase in photons. With an increase in photons, there is an increase in the amount of ejected electrons. Light must have the correct frequency or energy to eject electrons of a certain energy.<br \/>2.

When an electron absorbs or releases energy, it jumps to another orbital. The change in energy of the electron is quantized. Only certain amounts of energy can be released. Each frequency of light has specific spectral lines since each frequency causes a specific change in energy between orbitals.","  <b>Vocabulary:<\/b>  <a class='pjumpToTopic' href='javascript:void(0)' data-chap='23' data-topic='1' data-subtopic='1' data-subsection='1'>photoelectric effect<\/a>, <a class='pjumpToTopic' href='javascript:void(0)' data-chap='23' data-topic='1' data-subtopic='2' data-subsection='0'>Bohr atom<\/a>","  <b>STEM Skills:<\/b>  <b>    <br \/>  <\/b>1.
