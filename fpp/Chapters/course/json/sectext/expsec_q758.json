For example, the declination in Seattle is about 20°. Declination depends on one’s location on Earth. For this reason, some maps include the magnetic declination for the region they cover. ","The needles on most compasses today only rotate in the horizontal plane, but you can use a compass that also rotates vertically, called a dip needle, to estimate latitude, the north/south component of location. Near a magnetic pole, the needle points more vertically than at the equator. The diagram gives you a sense of how compasses with this feature worked. Several hundred years ago, many compasses had this feature. "],"objNames":["wb_declination_concepts","wb_latitude_concepts"]}
