Mechanical waves are one type of wave we discuss, with electromagnetic being the other type. ","Water is one medium for mechanical waves. A water wave in an ocean, a lake, or even a bathtub, is an example of a mechanical wave.","Seismic waves are mechanical waves that travel through Earth.  Large-amplitude seismic waves are felt as earthquakes.","A <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_harmonics_concepts1'>taut string<\/a> can also be a medium for mechanical waves. Vibrating particles in a plucked string are a mechanical wave.  Instruments like a piano or violin use such waves. ","Note that a stadium crowd wave \u2212 as people stand up and down in sequence around a stadium \u2212 resembles a wave, but technically is not one.  Mechanical waves require forces to act between neighboring particles, which are lacking in a stadium crowd \u2212 peer pressure doesn\u2019t count as a force.","We will be focusing on mechanical waves but briefly want to mention <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_em_waves_concepts1'>electromagnetic waves<\/a>, made of electric and magnetic fields. Electromagnetic waves include light, microwaves, and radio signals.  Unlike mechanical waves, electromagnetic waves do not require a medium \u2212 they can travel in a vacuum."],"objNames":["wb_mechanical_wave_examples","wb_wave_concept"]}
