They provide a good example of how mirrors can be used in sophisticated optical equipment.  As you can see, both a plane and a parabolic mirror are used in the system.","Here is an illustration of a reflecting telescope. This type of telescope is a Newtonian reflector, named after Sir Isaac Newton, who pioneered the design. Light reflects off a curved primary mirror, then off a small flat secondary mirror, and then through an eyepiece lens to the eye.","The telescope serves two purposes.  It gathers and concentrates light coming through a large opening, making objects brighter and more visible to the user.  And it magnifies the object as well, making details far more obvious."],"objNames":["wb_reflecting_telescope_concepts"]}
