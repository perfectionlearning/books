    "The Scottish scientist and mathematician James Maxwell summarized the properties of electromagnetic radiation with four equations.  His equations can be used to show that light is a wave consisting of changing electric and magnetic fields. ",
    "You have already studied one of Maxwell’s equations: <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_faraday_equation'>Faraday’s law</a>.  It says a changing magnetic field induces an electric field.  Another Maxwell equation says that a changing electric field induces a magnetic field.  Using this and other work, Maxwell showed that light, and electromagnetic radiation in general, consists of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. ",
    "Maxwell also theoretically determined the speed of light using his equations. When it was measured, it matched his prediction."
