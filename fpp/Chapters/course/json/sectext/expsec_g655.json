Momentum due to rotation, called <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_angular_momentum_body_concept1'>angular momentum<\/a>, is another topic. ","Momentum is proportional to mass and velocity. Let\u2019s assume the toy truck we show both has more mass and is moving faster than the car.  For both reasons, the truck has a greater amount of momentum. ","Momentum is a vector \u2212 it points in the same direction as the velocity, which is the direction of motion. The vectors you see in the upper diagram represent the vehicles\u2019 momentums, with the longer arrow of the truck confirming it has greater momentum than the car.
