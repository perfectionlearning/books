Resistivity measures the opposition to current flow of a <b>particular <\/b><b>material<\/b>.   ","Resistivity is the inverse of conductivity, how easily current flows through a material. Typical conductors, such as copper, have low resistivity. Insulators, such as rubber or glass, have high resistivity. ","The resistance of a component is a function of its geometry as well as the resistivity of the material from which it is made. ","The equation lets you see how geometry and resistivity determine resistance.  For instance, the equation reflects that a short, fat resistor will have less resistance than a long, thin one.  And for a particular shape, the resistance will be less if it is made from a good conductor, such as copper.  "],"objNames":["wb_resistivity_concepts","wb_resistance_components"]}
