In this section, we discuss some ways this can be quantified.","An object radiates energy at a rate that is proportional to its Kelvin temperature raised to the <b>fourth<\/b> power, and to its surface area. The Sun is both hot \u2212 about 6,000 kelvins at its surface \u2212 and huge \u2212 its surface area is six billion square meters. This means it radiates an enormous amount of energy every second.","The energy from the Sun travels in all directions. Some strikes Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The power of the Sun\u2019s radiation, the energy per second that reaches our planet, is  1.8\u00d710<sup class=\"\">17<\/sup> watts. ","About 20 kilowatts reaches the roof of the average American house, which is about four times the power that a house uses. You see a solar collector on the roof of a house. It uses the energy of the Sun\u2019s radiation to warm water used in the home.  ","Such systems are not perfectly efficient, so even though enough solar power may reach the house during sunny periods, it cannot necessarily power the house around the clock.  Other factors such as the initial cost and storing energy for the night are obstacles that can be surmounted with good design and sufficient investment.
