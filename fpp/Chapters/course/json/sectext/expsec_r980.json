With these devices, the goal is to provide images that are as lifelike as possible.  This is done by making the picture elements (pixels) very small and spacing them close together, so they cannot be individually resolved. Brand names involving terms such as \u201cretina display\u201d refer to resolution.  ","To discuss resolution, we use the term resolving power. Resolving power is a measure of an instrument\u2019s ability to distinguish between two objects. Modern optical equipment such as the Hubble Space Telescope can achieve extraordinary resolution."],"objNames":["wb_resolving_concepts1"]}
