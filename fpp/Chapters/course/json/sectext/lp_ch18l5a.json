[OBJ:expsec_r980:Resolving power] is the ability to distinguish between two objects. In objects that [OBJ:expsec_r981:appear separate], the diffraction patterns are separate from each other. In objects that are [OBJ:expsec_r981:blurry], the diffraction patterns are overlapping. Diffraction is crucial to resolving power.<br />2. [OBJ:pwsec_r989:Computer displays] are made of pixels. The number of pixels in computer and cell phone displays is increasing, leading to greater pixel density and greater resolution.<br />3. To calculate the approximate minimum angle needed to resolve an image, use [OBJ:expsec_r983:Rayleigh's criterion]. Multiply 1.22 by the wavelength, divided by the aperture diameter.","  <b>Vocabulary:</b>  [OBJ:expsec_r980:resolving power], [OBJ:pwsec_r989:pixel], [OBJ:pwsec_r989:pixel density], [OBJ:expsec_r985:diffraction gratings], [OBJ:pwsec_r987:grating spectroscope], [OBJ:expsec_r983:Rayleigh's criterion]","  <b>STEM Skills:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1.
