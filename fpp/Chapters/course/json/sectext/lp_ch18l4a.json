Light interference patterns caused by [OBJ:expsec_r977:single-slit diffraction] cause a large central band, with light bands that fade the farther they are from the central band. Just as in double-slit diffraction, in single-slit diffraction, constructive interference causes bright bands, and destructive interference causes dark bands.","  <b>STEM Skills:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1.
