","Thermometers use physical properties to measure temperature. The one you see in the first diagram relies on the fact that liquids expand at a predictable rate with temperature. The scale of the thermometer measures the amount of expansion \u2212 how much longer the column becomes as the liquid\u2019s thermal energy increases.","Thermostats, which contain thermometers, are used to control furnaces and air conditioners. Thermometers found in older thermostats use bimetallic strips \u2212 two different metal strips attached side by side.  As the temperature rises, one metal <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_linear_thermal_concepts1'>expands<\/a> more rapidly than the other, and the bimetallic strip bends, opening a circuit that stops the furnace. ","Thermometers for measuring human temperature can also rely on detecting radiation from an object, like the digital version shown in the second diagram.  This thermometer measures the infrared radiation from a human body.  The peak frequency of the radiation relates to the body\u2019s temperature.","Other devices use the fact that a substance\u2019s <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_resistivity_concepts'>resistivity<\/a> \u2212 how hard or easy it is for electricity to flow through it \u2212 changes with temperature.
