For instance, scientists such as Albert Einstein and Robert Oppenheimer both contributed to the theory behind and the creation of atomic bombs, but also warned society of their dangers.  Albert Einstein was also one of the creators of the International Refugee Committee, which helped to resettle refugees after World War II and continues to serve this function today.","Scientists also contribute in practical manners to society and contemporary thought.  Sir Isaac Newton ran the British Mint, responsible for creating and controlling the British currency.  As a more recent example, physicist Andy Grove led Intel to its leadership position in the industry of producing computer microprocessors.","Physicists and other scientists continue to contribute to society.  An insightful book on global warming, \u201cSustainable Energy  \u2212 Without the Hot Air,\u201d was written by the British physicist David J.C. MacKay. He leads his country\u2019s efforts to set a policy strategy to cease global warming.  In a similar role, Steven Chu was the Energy Secretary for the United States, leading efforts to set a renewable fuel strategy for the United States.","Scientists\u2019 contributions are not limited to scientific and public policy challenges.  For instance, the physicist Alan Lightman has written the best-selling novel \u201cEinstein\u2019s Dreams\u201d and has also received awards from the Cambodian government for his work concerning women\u2019s rights."],"objNames":["wb_physicists1","wb_physicists2"]}
