","Lifting the pot changes its macroscopic properties, properties that describe its properties as a whole.","If you put the pot on a burner and turn on the heat, you will change the microscopic properties of the pot’s contents. If you were viewing an individual molecule, it might vibrate faster, move to a new location, or form new relationships with other molecules, ones with more potential energy.  The exact results would differ by molecule. ","A macroscopic property, the water’s thermal energy, would increase.  The water’s temperature, another macroscopic property reflecting average kinetic energy of all molecules, would also increase.
