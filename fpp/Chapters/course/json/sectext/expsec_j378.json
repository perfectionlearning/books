Here you see two stationary blocks of different masses, chosen so that the same fluid supports each of them. Why? Because the pressure is the same underneath both masses. The more massive block applies more downward force than the smaller block, but it applies it over a proportionally greater area. This means the pressure is the same on both sides. For the pressure to be equal, it is important that the two points must be at the same depth, as they are here.","The ratio of force to area equals the pressure, and that is the same on both sides.  This is why the system balances the blocks.","The first equation states that pressure at one point in an enclosed fluid is the same as at any other point at the same depth.","The second equation states the same principle using the definition of pressure."],"objNames":["wb_pascal_principle_concepts","wb_pascal_equation"]}
