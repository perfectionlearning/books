Potential differences cause electrons and other charged particles to move. Here you see two oppositely charged plates connected to a <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_batteries1'>battery<\/a>. The battery causes the potential difference between the plates. ","The equation shows how to calculate electric potential difference.
