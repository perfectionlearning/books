We drop all the zeros to the right of the decimal point until we come to the first digit that is not a zero. We use the remaining digits to form our leading value. Here, the leading value is 2.5.","To make 2.5 equivalent to 0.0025 multiply it by <math><mrow><mfrac linethickness=\"thin\"><mn>1</mn><mrow><mn>1000</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>.</mo></mrow></math> We write <math><mrow><mfrac linethickness=\"thin\"><mn>1</mn><mrow><mn>1000</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math> using exponential notation. The 3 zeros mean this is <span class=\"math\">10<sup>−3</sup></span>. The exponent is <span class=\"math\">−3</span>, since the 1,000 is in the denominator.  ","There is a common shortcut to calculate the exponent. You count how many places the decimal point moved. It moved 3 places to the left here, which means the power of 10 is <span class=\"math\">10<sup>−3</sup></span>. The sign of the exponent is negative if the decimal place is moved to the left."],"objNames":["wb_math_smallNumberSN"]}
