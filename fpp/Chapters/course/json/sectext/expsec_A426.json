The Universe started small and expanded rapidly − a Big Bang. ","At the start of the Big Bang, the entire Universe occupied a space that was a few millimeters across, the size of a few grains of rice. Its temperature was unimaginably high. In a trillionth of a trillionth of a second, it expanded to a size comparable to the size of today’s Universe. The expansion continues.  In this process, space and time emerged. ","Why do scientists accept the Big Bang model?  One reason is consistent data that the Universe is expanding.  The astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that the light from distant galaxies exhibits a red shift − they are moving away from us, showing that the Universe is expanding.","Other evidence includes the large amount of helium present in the Universe.  Much more helium is present than can be explained by fusion within stars, which is creating it from hydrogen. The incredible temperatures present at the Big Bang quantitatively explain the large amounts of helium in our Universe. ","Further evidence includes the microwave background radiation that astronomers have observed.  Its temperature is consistent with the Big Bang model. Another piece of evidence is the presence of deuterium in the Universe.  Even stars are not hot enough to create deuterium, but the temperature and expansion of the Big Bang could have created this substance."],"objNames":["wb_big_bang_concepts"]}
