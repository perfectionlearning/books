In an inelastic collision, kinetic energy is <b>not</b> conserved. ","We use a pair of football players to discuss an inelastic collision. One football player is about to be tackled by another.  Does the total kinetic energy of this system of two players stay the same?","No, there is less kinetic energy in the system after he is tackled.  The kinetic energy becomes other forms of energy, such as elastic potential energy, sound (acoustic energy), heat, and so on.","To define an inelastic collision with an equation, we write in the first equation that the initial kinetic energy is greater than the final kinetic energy. ","The second equation tells what we know is true of collisions: Momentum is conserved.  In other words, the initial and final momentums are the same."],"objNames":["wb_inelastic_collision_defined","wb_inelastic_collision_equation"]}
