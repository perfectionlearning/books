","As we show in the diagram, the pickup is an element of an electrical circuit placed directly below the guitar string. The pickup consists of a coil looped around a permanent magnetic core. The magnet in the pickup magnetizes the guitar string. The magnetic field lines in the illustration are those of the magnetized string.","When the guitar player plucks a string, she makes it vibrate. The frequency of the string\u2019s vibration determines the pitch of the note it produces.","As the string vibrates, it moves up and down near the pickup coil. You can see how this moves the magnetic field. The changes in magnetic field strength through the coil induce an emf that causes a current to flow in the coil. The current changes at the same frequency with which the string vibrates. ","The changing current flows to the amplifier, which increases the energy of the signal, and then transmits it to the speakers. "],"objNames":["wb_e_induction_guitar_concepts"]}
