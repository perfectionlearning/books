In both, an electric charge is moving in a magnetic field.","You control the initial velocity of a positively charged particle that moves in a magnetic field, represented by red field lines. In the illustration for the first activity, you see that the magnetic field points straight down the screen, and the initial velocity vector points to the right, perpendicular to the magnetic field. As the particle moves, you will see the force exerted on it by the magnetic field represented by a purple vector.","Launch the upper simulation and conduct some experiments. Does the moving particle travel along a straight line or a curve? To answer this question, you will need to change the viewing angle. In the process, you will see why a three-dimensional view of a charged particle moving through a magnetic field is so useful.","As we mentioned, the second simulation works the same as the first.  It simply starts with a different perspective. When a vector arrow points toward you, it is often shown as the tip of an arrow. The two perspectives should give you a good starting sense of the relationship of the velocity of the charge, the direction of the magnetic field, and the force applied by the field.
