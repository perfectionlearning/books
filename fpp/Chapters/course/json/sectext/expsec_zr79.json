Whatever physics the Greeks did not first pioneer, it often seems that Sir Isaac Newton was the source. However, the application of the theory of gravity to the orbits of astronomical objects was a team effort. ","One inspiration to scientists of his era was comets.  These showy objects inspired scientists to understand their orbits, in part to predict when they would return. A crucial piece of the puzzle was what we now call Kepler\u2019s laws of orbits.  Based on observations made by the Danish scientist Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler had concluded that planets move in elliptical orbits, and deduced other aspects of their <a class='pjumpToTopic' href='javascript:void(0)' data-chap='1' data-topic='4' data-subtopic='1' data-subsection='0'>motion<\/a>.  However, he could not explain why. ","Technology also played a crucial role.  In the decades preceding Newton, optical <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_reflecting_telescope_concepts'>telescopes<\/a> were conceived of, built, and significantly improved. Previously, astronomy had been done without the benefit of lenses or mirrors..  Scientists across the world could now make astronomical observations. Newton used geometry and his theory of gravity to explain the observed elliptical orbits.  Edmond Halley in turn used Newton\u2019s work to determine the orbit and <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_UCM_period_concept'>period<\/a>of the comet we now call Halley\u2019s comet. In the 20<sup class=\"\">th<\/sup> century, spacecraft from multiple countries including Japan and joint efforts from Europe could even \u201cvisit\u201d the comet to study scientists\u2019 theories about the nature of comets.","In the 1900s, Einstein further developed the theory of gravity in his <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_general_rel'>general theory of relativity<\/a>.   General relativity revolutionized the way we think about space and time, and it has also had important experimental effects. For example, <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_market_service1'>GPS devices<\/a> rely on a system of accelerating satellites that exchange radio signals, and which carry atomic clocks that are synchronized. None of this would be possible without the theoretical groundwork of general relativity."],"objNames":["wb_gravity_1"]}
