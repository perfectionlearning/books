","Wave speed also equals wavelength divided by period.  The wavelength is the distance between two adjacent peaks, and the period is the time it takes for a peak to travel that distance \u2212 so the equation is just dividing that distance by the travel time. ","Since frequency and period are reciprocals, we can also say that the wave speed equals the product of wavelength and frequency. "],"objNames":["wb_wave_speed_equationa","wb_wave_speed_equation"]}
