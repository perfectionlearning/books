	"Since golf is a popular sport, others may have researched this issue. You could research this using books, journals and so on.",
	"Even if you don’t find specific information on golf balls, look for other relevant models concerning motion, which may explain the phenomena or provide a starting point for your model.",
	"Answer the question to the best of your ability: Do some golf balls go straighter?",
	"Use specific evidence from texts and other sources as a basis for your analysis. Determine the key ideas and conclusions of a text and summarize them, using simpler but still accurate terms.",
	"Look for any gaps or contradictions in these materials. Also pay attention to any important distinctions an author may supply (for instance, how a ball rolls on a smooth surface versus a rougher one, such as a golf green).",
	"Analyze how information and ideas are organized and placed in categories. This will help you demonstrate your understanding of the information and ideas.",
	"Are there concepts you learned in physics − perhaps friction, air resistance or angular momentum − that might apply here?",
	"Plan a presentation − use a computer presentation, or arrive with a putter and some golf balls…. Argue your case using appropriate evidence and reasoning.",
	"Evaluate the merits of explanations produced by others, such as an explanation provided by a manufacturer. Or encourage another team of students to analyze the same question, and present their results."
