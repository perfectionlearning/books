In the activity in this section, you can explore the relationship between the two.","You control the amount and direction of the current in the wire you see. The magnetic field created by the current will be displayed as field lines on the screen. Arrows indicate the direction of the magnetic field. In addition, a field meter that you can move displays the magnetic field strength.","The simulation displays the magnetic field strength in two fashions. First, the closer together the field lines, the stronger the field. Second, the darker the field lines, the stronger the field. ","First, answer two questions about magnetic field strength: How does its strength relate to the amount of current? to the distance from the wire?","Second, you can also study the orientation of the magnetic field. How does the orientation relate to the direction of the current? Does it change when the direction of the current changes?"],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_31_0"]}
