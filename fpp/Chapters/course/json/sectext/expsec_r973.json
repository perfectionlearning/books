Each point on the wave front is the source of vibrating, spherical wavelets. ","Huygens\u2019 principle states that, at any time, the wave front is tangent to the front surface of the wavelets. The blue line of the wave front here is parallel to each wavelet\u2019s leading edge \u2212 which is to say it is tangent to them. The wave front moves at the same speed as the wavelets."],"objNames":["wb_huygen_concepts1"]}
