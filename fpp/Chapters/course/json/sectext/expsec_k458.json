    "Liquids and gases are both fluids. Remember that <a class='pjumpToTopic' href='javascript:void(0)' data-chap='10' data-topic='0' data-subtopic='1' data-subsection='0'>fluids</a> can flow and change shape easily.",
    "Liquids have a definite volume, unlike gases. It is hard to compress them âˆ’ their volume is roughly constant.",
    "Liquids are held together by forces of attraction between their molecules. These forces are not strong chemical bonds in which electrons are shared or transferred between atoms, as they are with solids.  With our example of water, we show that each water molecule is held to nearby water molecules by relatively weak intermolecular bonds.",
    "As with solids, when heat transfers to a liquid, the molecules begin moving faster and its temperature increases. At the boiling point, as heat continues to flow, the intermolecular bonds holding the liquid molecules together begin to break. The liquid begins to change to a gas."
