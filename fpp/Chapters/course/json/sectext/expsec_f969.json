","Potential energy (<i>PE</i>) is due to the positions of objects in a system and the forces they exert on one another. The paint bucket is perched on scaffolding, a height <i>h</i> above the ground. It has more potential energy than if it were on the ground.","Potential energy requires a system of objects. The paint bucket we mentioned is part of the bucket-Earth system that has potential energy because of the gravitational force between Earth and the bucket.  No Earth, no potential energy.","Other forms of energy include elastic potential energy. The more the bow is flexed, the more potential energy it has. Another form we will mention is chemical potential energy, such as that stored in batteries."],"objNames":["wb_pe_definition","wb_pe_definition1"]}
