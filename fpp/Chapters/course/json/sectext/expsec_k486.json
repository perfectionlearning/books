    "Convection is another way for heat to flow. Convection is heat flow due to the large movement and circulation of warmer and cooler parts of a gas or liquid. Ovens rely on convection for baking: the hotter air near the heating element rises and the cooler air along the sides sinks. In fact, “convection ovens” have fans to accelerate this flow process. ",
    "Natural convection generally happens due to expansion and gravity, without any outside work being required.  For instance, warm air naturally rises, since it is less <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_density_concepts'>dense</a> than cooler air.",
    "Convection can also be assisted.  For instance, a pump can push hot liquid in a heating system, forcing it to go more quickly to locations where heat is desired. "
