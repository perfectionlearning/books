    "This section introduces a set of equations for solving problems involving rotational motion. The equations apply only when the angular acceleration is constant. ",
    "These equations parallel the ones used in <a class='pjumpToTopic' href='javascript:void(0)' data-chap='1' data-topic='4' data-subtopic='1' data-subsection='0'>linear motion</a>.  The rotational quantities, such as angular displacement, simply replace their linear equivalents. ",
    "As with the linear motion equations, using these equations typically involves choosing an equation where all the values but one are known.  These equations can be derived from the equations shown earlier in this chapter.  "
