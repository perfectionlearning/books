We start with the more traditional type of heat pump.","The first diagram shows a traditional type of heat pump. Work done on the gas in the pump causes heat to flow from a colder location to a warmer one.  (Heat will not flow spontaneously from cold to hot, so work is required.)  You may notice that this type of heat pump is the same as a heat engine, but run in reverse, with work causing this direction of heat flow.","Buildings use this form of heat pump to more efficiently warm their interiors. Heat pumps can be more efficient than traditional furnaces since they take advantage of thermal energy in the environment. ","In the second diagram, we show a geothermal heat pump. A geothermal heat pump has pipes running underground where the earth is warmer.  The liquid there absorbs thermal energy.","A pump then propels the liquid up, into the buildingâ€™s interior. The thermal energy of the gas is conserved as it moves from location to location.","Heat flows from the liquid to the building interior, and then the liquid repeats this cycle. In other words, the cooler liquid is pumped back underground, absorbs thermal energy, and is pumped up once again. "],"objNames":["wb_heat_pump_concepts","wb_heat_pump_concepts2"]}
