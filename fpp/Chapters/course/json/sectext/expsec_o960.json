This system starts out electrically neutral: although each disk is charged, the two together contain an equal number of electrons and protons. The net charge is the sum of these charges, which is zero. ","Even though charges can move from object to object, the net charge of the system of two disks remains constant. Before the movement, the system was neutral.  Its net charge equaled zero. After the electrons move, the overall system still contains the same number of electrons and protons. This means the net charge of the system stays the same, and remains zero.  ","We use the term “isolated system” to describe the disks − no charge moves in or out of the system of the two disks.  If it could, then the system would not be isolated, and its net charge could change."],"objNames":["wb_conservation_charge_concepts"]}
