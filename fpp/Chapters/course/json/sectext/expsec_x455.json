(They were able to look at such lines thanks to Robert Bunsen, who invented a powerful gas burner, and who is memorialized for the burner used in many chemistry labs). <br \/><br \/>If you look at the light emitted when hydrogen gas is heated, it does <b>not<\/b> form a continuous spectrum.  Rather, it is quantized, consisting of light with very specific wavelengths. You only see visible light of the colors and wavelengths shown here \u2212 you do not see, say, yellow. ","This was surprising to scientists: Why was the spectrum not continuous? And why was there light of these particular colors, or wavelengths, and not others? ","Other chemical compounds produce different emission spectra.  Fireworks take advantage of this phenomenon.  The fireworks we show have a blue color, emitted by copper salts, a color that is part of the salts\u2019 emission spectrum.","If you compare the emission spectra of different elements or compounds, you will note that some have similar colors, but each substance has a unique combination of colors.
