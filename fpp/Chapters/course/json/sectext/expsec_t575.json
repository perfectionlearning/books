Note that these equations cannot be used for lenses.","The <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_mirror_vocab_3'>focal length<\/a> of a concave spherical mirror equals one-half the radius of the sphere from which it can be formed.  This radius is the distance from the mirror\u2019s surface to its center of curvature.  The focal length of a concave mirror is positive, since the focal point is on the same side of the mirror as the object. ","The focal point of a convex mirror is behind the mirror\u2019s surface. This means the focal length of a convex spherical mirror is negative, and its focal length equation reflects that fact.  Pun intended. ","The equations show that a more tightly curved mirror, one that can be thought of as coming from a smaller sphere, focuses images closer to the mirror than a mirror that is almost flat."],"objNames":["wb_focal_length_mirror_2","wb_focal_length_mirror_concave"]}
