","A resistor, like the one shown, is a component that can be used to resist current. The stripes on it indicate the amount of its resistance. The term \u201cresistor\u201d is also used more broadly to describe anything, such as a light bulb, that provides resistance to current flow. ","Resistors can be used to control the amount of current as well, similar in some ways to how gates in canals, and valves regulate the flow of water. Resistors function by making it more difficult for current to flow, analogous in some ways to friction that opposes one object sliding past another.  ","Resistors can be specially-made components such as the one we show here, designed to determine the operation of an electrical circuit.  But a light bulb, or the heating element in a toaster, also functions as a resistor, with the resistance to current flow creating light and heat."],"objNames":["wb_resistor_concepts"]}
