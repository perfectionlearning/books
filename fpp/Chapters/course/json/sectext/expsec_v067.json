Sadly, that topic is outside the scope of this book.  Radioactivity is another way that unstable atoms can decay, in addition to fission, the splitting of the nucleus. That topic does belong in this book.","A nucleus, like that of uranium-238, may decay spontaneously, emitting a particle in order to reach a more stable state. Isotopes that spontaneously emit particles are said to be radioactive, and the process is called “radioactivity.”","The particle that is emitted in this example, called an alpha particle, is electrically charged, so the nucleus must have a new charge, because it has a different number of protons than before. When the nuclear charge is different, the atom has transmuted, that is, it has become a different chemical element. As the diagram shows, uranium-238 has become thorium-234.
