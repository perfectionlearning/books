This force is not constant. In this discussion, we only discuss the force that the bat applies on the ball, ignoring other, smaller forces such as air resistance.","At the moment of contact, the bat and ball are moving toward each other. The force on the ball increases as they come together and the ball compresses against the bat. ","As the ball begins to move away from the bat, the bat’s force on the ball is reduced. This force becomes zero at the instant the ball leaves the bat. ","The concept of impulse helps you to understand this collision. Impulse is equal both to the average force multiplied by elapsed time, and to the change in momentum. The impulse equals the area shown under the force-time curve. It also equals the product of average force and elapsed time, which is the area of the rectangle enclosed by the dashed line."],"objNames":["wb_baseball_impulse_concepts"]}
