We show how three rays can be used to locate the image, using the penguin\u2019s head as the source of the light rays. These diagrams can be fairly complex \u2212 we suggest watching the video where you can see one ray drawn at a time.","Ray 1 starts parallel to the principal axis and reflects down through the focal point. We show a virtual extension of the reflected ray, extended backward through the mirror, as a dashed line. It will be needed to locate the image. ","Ray 2 is drawn through the focal point, then through the penguin\u2019s head, then to the mirror where it reflects parallel to the axis. We draw the virtual \u201cback end\u201d of the reflected ray with a dashed line.","Ray 3 is shown starting through the center of curvature. It reflects back along the same line. We again use a virtual ray to indicate the continuation of the reflected ray backward through the mirror.","When we continue each reflected ray backward through the mirror, the virtual extensions intersect.","The light rays started at the penguin\u2019s head.  Draw the image of the penguin so that its head is at the intersection of the virtual rays. The image is upright, larger than the object, and virtual. This is the type of image of your own face that you see in a magnifying mirror."],"objNames":["wb_concave_mirror_redux_concepts2","wb_concave_mirror_redux_concepts5"]}
