So does the location of any peak or trough that you might track − you will see the peak move in the direction of the wave.    ","In contrast, a standing wave does not “travel” but “stands” in the same location.  For instance, the locations of maximum displacement (peaks and troughs) do not move left or right in the diagram.","A standing wave is created by two traveling waves with the same amplitude and wavelength that are moving in opposite directions in the same medium. In the diagram, we show them on separate strings so you can more easily see each wave. ","When the two waves are combined on the same string, the result is a standing wave that does not travel but stays in a fixed position. Some points on the string move up and down with maximum displacement, alternating between peak and trough.  At other points there is no oscillation at all.  In a standing wave, the locations of these types of points do not change. ","The wave can be described with a constant outline, where the locations of peaks and troughs, and points with no oscillation at all, remain fixed.  In contrast, with each of the two individual traveling waves that combine to form this standing wave, the location of a peak changes over time, “traveling” from left to right, or right to left."],"objNames":["wb_standing_waves_concepts","wb_standing_waves_concepts3"]}
