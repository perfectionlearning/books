To calculate the root mean square of a set of numbers, square each of the numbers, calculate the average of those squares, and then evaluate the square root of that average. ","With gases, the rms speed is used instead of the average speed in several equations. This is because we are interested in the average values of quantities, such as kinetic energy, that depend on the square of a property.","The root-mean-square speed of a gas molecule can be calculated when the gas\u2019s temperature and molar mass are known. The rms speed increases with a gas\u2019s temperature, and decreases with its molar mass. The molar mass is measured in kilograms per mole.","The rms speed can also be calculated using Boltzmann\u2019s constant and the mass of a molecule.  ","You see a table of the root-mean-square speeds of the molecules of some gases in our atmosphere at 273 K. The molar masses of the gases are also shown. You can see that as the molar mass increases, the rms speed decreases."],"objNames":["wb_RMS_speed_equation","wb_table_rms_gas"]}
