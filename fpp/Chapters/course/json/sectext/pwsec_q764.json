It can also be used to determine the relative amount of different particles in a sample, by directing particles of different masses to different regions of a recording plate, where they are counted. ","How does a mass spectrometer work? Before a substance is put into the mass spectrometer, it is vaporized and ionized. Ionizing means that one electron from every atom or molecule is removed. This leaves each particle − called an ion − with a net positive charge of a proton. When an ion enters the electric field shown at the bottom left of the sketch, the electric field accelerates it. ","When the moving particle enters the magnetic field, its velocity is perpendicular to the field. This means that it will move in a circle whose radius depends on the strength of the magnetic field as well as the particle’s mass, velocity, and charge. The experimenter controls the initial velocity by setting the strength of the electric field and can observe the radius. Using these factors, she can calculate the particle’s mass.
