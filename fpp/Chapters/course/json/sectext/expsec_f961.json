You would hear about work in one ear and about energy in the other.  But we cannot, so we are going to talk about energy a bit, and then return to work. ","Although it is an important topic in physics, energy is hard to define.  In some ways, it is like force: There are many types of forces, from tension to friction to weight.  Similarly, there are many types of energy (and, yes, we will get to many of them shortly).","We will start with one property of energy: The energy an object has is changed when work is done on it, or by it.","As we noted, there are many types of energy: chemical, electric, atomic, kinetic (energy of motion), potential (energy of position), just to name a few. In the illustrations, we show two forms of energy, elastic potential energy, and kinetic energy.  Each has its own equation, so it will take a few sections to run through them.  For now, please focus on the fact that work changes an object’s energy.   "],"objNames":["wb_energy_concept","wb_energy_concept2"]}
