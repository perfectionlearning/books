To illustrate this idea, we use a rotating compact disc. ","The CD is rigid, which means the particles all rotate with the same angular velocity, and each remains at a constant distance from the axis. We can determine the angular momentum of the CD by summing the angular momentums of all the particles that make it up. ","Simpler than summing up the angular momentum of each particle is using an object’s moment of inertia.  It does the summing for you.  Angular momentum equals the product of the moment of inertia and angular velocity.  This is analogous to linear momentum, which is the product of mass and linear velocity."],"objNames":["wb_angular_momentum_body_concept1","wb_angular_momentum_body_concept"]}
