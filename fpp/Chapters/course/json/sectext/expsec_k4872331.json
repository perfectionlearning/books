    "Electromagnetic radiation includes sunlight. If you sit outside on a sunny day and feel warmer: Your thermal energy has been increased by sunlight, a form of electromagnetic radiation.  ",
    "Microwave ovens provide another example of using electromagnetic radiation to transfer thermal energy, in this case, into food. ",
    "The amount of radiation emitted by an object, and analyzing its <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_wavelength_concept'>wavelength</a> distribution can have medical applications. You see a photograph that records the infrared radiation a horse emits.",
    "The photo was taken using a system that assigns colors to normally invisible infrared radiation. The yellow and red areas show that the ears and mouth emit the most infrared energy, and are the warmest. An area that is warmer or cooler than usual may indicate illness or muscle strain."
