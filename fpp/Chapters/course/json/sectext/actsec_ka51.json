In the simulation, you are the pilot of a small spaceship. There are three locations nearby that you want to visit. ","To reach any of these locations, you describe the displacement vector of the spaceship by setting its <i>x<\/i> (horizontal) and <i>y<\/i> (vertical) components. In other words, you set how far horizontally you want to travel, and how far vertically. ","See if you can reach all three places. Hint: Remember the components of a vector are calculated by subtracting its starting point from its endpoint. "],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_3_0"]}
