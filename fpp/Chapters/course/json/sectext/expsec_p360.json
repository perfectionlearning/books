    "In general, power equals the rate of work, or the change of energy per unit time.  Electric power can be calculated using the definitions of current and voltage.",
    "Electric power equals the product of the current through a resistor and the potential difference across it.",
    "Power is measured in watts, the standard unit for power. The current must be measured in amperes, and the potential difference in volts.",
    "Using Ohm’s law to substitute for potential difference or current, we write two equivalent equations to find the power used by a resistor. The three equations let us choose which two properties we use when calculating electric power. "
