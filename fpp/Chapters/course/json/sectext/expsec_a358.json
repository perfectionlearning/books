We substitute these values.","The fraction bar is a grouping symbol, like parentheses.  We do the subtraction in the numerator and the addition in the denominator first. ","With the subtraction and addition done, we perform the division called for by the fraction bar, and can simplify the fraction. "],"objNames":["wb_math_smpl_evaluateExpression"]}
