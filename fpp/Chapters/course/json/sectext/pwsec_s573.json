","One way to understand the impact of scattering is to observe what happens when there is no atmosphere, which means there is no scattering. An astronaut in space sees crisp white stars in a black sky. Where there is atmosphere − near the surface of Earth − the astronaut sees a thin blue line due to the scattering of sunlight.  ","The Sun and the stars appear white from space. This illustration shows the full spectrum of visible light emitted by the Sun. None of it is scattered in the vacuum of space. Why does the Sun appear white, and not the yellow color you are more accustomed to seeing? ","Again, the lack of scattering is the answer. With no atmosphere to scatter the light and remove some of the blue light, the astronaut sees all the colors of the spectrum in the Sun’s disk, and she perceives the combination of all the colors as white.
