We start again with just two nodes, locations of no motion, at the ends of the string.  We call this <i>n</i> = 1.  This standing wave fits half a wavelength into the length of the string.  The wavelength here is twice the length of the string, the reciprocal of one-half. ","The second harmonic, where <i>n</i> = 2, has a complete wavelength that fits into the length of the string, with a peak and a trough possible at the same time. The string length is equal to the wavelength.  ","In the <i>n</i> = 3 case, there are two antinodes between the fixed ends, and there is one complete wave form, and another half wave form, for one and a half wavelengths that fit into the length of the string.  The reciprocal of 3/2 is 2/3, so the wavelength here is 2/3 of the string length.","The essential point is that all possible wavelengths of standing waves can be calculated by multiplying the <i>n</i> = 1 wavelength by a simple fraction.  For instance, the <i>n</i> = 2 case always has half the wavelength of the first case. And the third wavelength is one-third the first. You may have seen the pattern: in general, the wavelength is 1/<i>n</i> times the wavelength of the fundamental frequency."],"objNames":["wb_harmonics_concepts"]}
