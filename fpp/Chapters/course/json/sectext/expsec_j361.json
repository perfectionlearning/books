","One factor in calculating pressure is the density of the fluid. For instance, the density of the water shown in the fish tank is 1,000 kilograms per cubic meter.","Another factor is <i>g<\/i>, freefall acceleration.  If you ever go scuba diving on Jupiter (say someone installs a swimming pool there), the pressure at any given depth due to the water will be greater than it is on Earth.  ","Finally, the pressure depends on the depth, or the height of the column of liquid pressing down on an object. The greater the depth, the greater the pressure. Density, <i>g<\/i>, and depth: They all factor into the weight of the liquid above a submerged object, and determine the pressure on it.  ","The equation follows our description: pressure is the product of the density, the freefall acceleration <i>g<\/i>, and the height.","The height is really the depth. We write it as height to stress that it is the liquid above that is creating the pressure. "],"objNames":["wb_pressure_liquids_concepts2","wb_pressure_liquid_equation"]}
