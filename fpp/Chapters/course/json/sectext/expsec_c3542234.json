Convection is the primary means of heat transfer in the Earth since rocks are generally poor heat conductors.  With convection, the matter itself moves, like the flow of hotter and colder water in a lake as it freezes.  Water just flows a lot faster − rocks are about a trillion times more viscous than water. ","At some locations, especially below oceans, the surface (crust) is so much cooler than the mantle and core that it is denser. Its higher density means that over time it sinks, just as cooler air settles toward the ground.  As the crust sinks, it warms, and some becomes warm and buoyant enough to return to the Earth’s surface. Convection also occurs as hot matter in the Earth’s mantle flows toward the surface.","This process is quite slow by human standards − less than a centimeter a year. But it is a process by which the Earth “recycles” matter, allowing it to sink, be reformed, and be part of the surface again.","Conduction also occurs within the Earth.  Heat flow within the core is believed to take place primarily by conduction, in part due to its high content of iron, which is a good conductor of heat."],"objNames":["wb_convection"]}
