","In an ion propulsion engine, a cloud of xenon gas is injected into the ionization chamber and bombarded with electrons. These electrons \u201cknock\u201d another electron off each xenon atom, creating positively charged xenon ions.","When a xenon ion enters the electric field between the two charged plates, the electric field accelerates the ion to a velocity of approximately 30,000 m\/s. This is nearly 10 times the velocity of the exhaust stream from chemical propellants. ","Why is this system of interest? It uses less mass to produce a similar amount of momentum as a traditional rocket fuel system, since it accelerates the ions to such a high velocity. Less massive systems are easier to launch from Earth. "],"objNames":["wb_ion_rocket_engine_concepts"]}
