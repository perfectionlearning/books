","Mass and weight are <b>not</b> the same.  Mass is an object’s resistance to acceleration, or it can be defined as the amount of matter. ","Weight is a force.   It is how hard the force of gravity is pulling an object.  It is proportional to the object’s mass.  On Earth, your weight is determined by your mass as well as Earth’s mass.  ","One way to remember this: Your mass is the same on Mercury, Earth, and Jupiter.  But your weight would change, as Jupiter pulls you with more gravitational force than Mercury does.   ","Another way to remember this:  You are “weightless” in deep space, floating within a starship − but you still have the same mass as you would on Earth. ","Although in everyday conversation, a kilogram is sometimes used to measure the weight of something, it is a unit of mass.  Weight is measured in newtons (or in pounds, if you are using the British system). "],"objNames":["wb_weight_is_not_mass"]}
