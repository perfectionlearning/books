Static cling is one example of electric force that you encounter in everyday life.  It occurs because charge can transfer when two objects rub against one another. ","Vigorous rubbing increases the contact between the surfaces and increases electron flow, leaving one object positively charged, and the other negatively. ","This occurs in clothes dryers, leading to static cling, and also can occur when you pull a wool hat off your head. The result is that your hair becomes positively charged, and the wool hat becomes negatively charged.  The electric force between the charged hairs means they repel one another, causing your hair to stand up and separate."],"objNames":["wb_e_force_every_day"]}
