We start by discussing how one type of transistor is built.","The bottom layer is called the substrate. It consists of doped <i>p</i>-type semiconductor material, which has a population of excess holes. ","Two small regions, called islands, of doped <i>n</i>-type semiconductor material sit atop the substrate. They are connected by a shallow channel, also made of <i>n</i>-type semiconductor material. This material contains a large population of mobile electrons. ","The substrate, islands, and channel are covered by a thin layer of insulating material. A conducting electrode, called the gate, is deposited upon the insulating layer. The insulator prevents any current flowing directly from the gate to the components below. This is the basic design of a transistor: Repeat this design about a half a billion times, or more, on a wafer of silicon, and you have a modern microprocessor or memory system."],"objNames":["wb_transistor1"]}
