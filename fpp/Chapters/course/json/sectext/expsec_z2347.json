Critics of nuclear power counter that the plants often cost more than estimated, and last for less time than predicted.","These factors make costs difficult to estimate.  Assumptions required to estimate the price to consumers include the costs of plants (building and operating costs often run higher than anticipated), the cost of uranium fuel (which must be projected 40 or even 60 years in the future), how long a plant will last, and many other factors. ","Some of the most intense debate about nuclear plants concerns “externalities” − costs that are not directly related to the operators and customers of the plant.  Nuclear-power supporters argue that nuclear plants do not contribute to global warming and can be safely operated.  This is a benefit to all, not just to customers of the plant. It is an externality.","Critics point to a trade-off: the challenges of storing nuclear waste and the widespread environmental damage of plant failures.  Again, the damage of radioactive discharges spreads far beyond the plant and its customers, even across entire continents, and beyond. This cost too is an externality."],"objNames":["wb_nuclear_power3","wb_nuclear_power4"]}
