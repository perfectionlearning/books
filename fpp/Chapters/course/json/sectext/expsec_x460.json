She would consider light as a wave. She would say that as the light’s intensity increased, the energy transported by the wave increased. As you will see, this is an incomplete way to explain what occurs.","Here we show what a classical physicist would expect. The initial light is less intense, which is a wave of lower amplitude. In the diagram, we show more intense light as a wave of higher amplitude. The classic physicist expects that the higher-amplitude wave will cause ejected electrons to move more quickly. You can conceive of this as being like an ocean wave: A more energetic wave will be taller, and if it collides with something like a boat, it will propel it with greater energy.
