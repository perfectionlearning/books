{"cards":[{"lines":[{"type":"title","text":"Crime scene investigation"}]}],"definitions":[],"secText":["In this section, you are an environmental investigator. A criminal has been dumping samples of a radioactive lead isotope into a vacant lot. Holy ecological disaster! A security camera has filmed three suspicious-looking characters in the vacant lot at different times.","The factory that creates the waste is cooperating with you. They tell you that the isotope was pure lead-209 samples that initially contained 192 billion atoms. When you find the waste, it is about midnight and 24 billion lead atoms remain.  In other words, one-eighth of the original lead-209 is left.","Your mission has three parts. First, determine how many half-lives have elapsed since the pure lead-209 sample was dumped. Second, measure the half-life of lead-209 using a technique similar to how you measured the half-life of C-14 in the previous simulation. ","Third, you can use the evidence from the security camera. The camera filmed Anna in the lot 6.51 hours before you obtained the sample. Sara was loitering in the area about 9.76 hours before this time, and a third suspect, Katherine, was filmed there 13.0 hours before you found the waste. This is all the information you need to nail the guilty party.  Drag the handcuffs to the dastardly dumper!"],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_43_21_2"]}
