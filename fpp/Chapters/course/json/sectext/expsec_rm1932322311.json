    "Of course, physicists continue their research, standing on the shoulders of earlier scientists.  Neil deGrasse Tyson works to make astronomy accessible to the general public, while researching star formation and exploding stars.  ",
    "Much research (and recent press) concerns the Higgs boson. The theoretical work of the British physicist Peter Higgs was recognized for predicting the existence, and leading to the eventual discovery, of this particle. His work built upon another Nobel prize winner, Hideki Yukawa, whose work in Japan and the United States helped lead to the model that the Higgs boson helps to confirm.",
    "Frank Wilczek is an American physicist and mathematician whose work has won the Nobel Prize. He has done fundamental research concerning <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_standard_model2'>quarks</a>.  He has explained some of the implications of his work in the book “The Lightness of Being.”",
	"Physicists such as those we mention here have varied backgrounds, talents and interests. Some start with a strong theoretical or math background; others have more of an engineering bent that they can apply to experiments. And as these biographies illustrate, they have a variety of goals, from explaining the workings of the cosmos or subatomic particles to writing materials that make such knowledge more accessible to the general public."
