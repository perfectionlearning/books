The Standard Model is required to explain other aspects of science, such as sub-nuclear processes and processes occurring at extreme energies.","The Standard Model is the explanation scientists developed during the 1970s to explain matter and forces.  It has successfully explained a large number of experimental results in the field of particle physics, and accurately predicted a wide variety of phenomena. Over time and through many experiments by many physicists, the Standard Model has become established as a well-tested physics theory.","According to the Standard Model, everything around us is made up of 12 different matter particles.  Matter particles are either quarks or leptons.  Each group consists of six particles.  ","Matter particles are members of generations. The lightest and most stable particles make up the first generation, while the heavier and less stable particles belong to the second and third generations. All stable matter in the Universe is made from particles that belong to the first generation.  Heavier particles quickly decay to the next most stable level."],"objNames":["wb_standard_model1"]}
