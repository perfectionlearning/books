How might we test that hypothesis? One way to measure whether the line is a good fit for the data is to measure the differences between the <i>y</i> values we observe, versus those that the formula predicts.","In the table above, we calculate the difference between the observed value and the predicted value. We want to summarize these differences (called residuals). We want an equation that minimizes the sum of the squared residuals.  ","We could continue the process by trying other lines.  For instance, we tried the line <i>y</i> = 6.5<i>x</i> + 26. It too looks close to the data, but the magnitude of the sum of the residuals was slightly larger than the sum for <i>y</i> = 7<i>x</i> + 24.  Given the reasonably small amount of data, both lines might be good models. (A spreadsheet computes the trendline as <i>y</i> = 7.0654<i>x</i> + 23.987, providing more precision than can be gained visually.)","We graph the residuals, the difference between the observed and predicted values.  Sometimes, graphing them this way may show a pattern in the residuals, but here, they seem fairly randomly distributed.  However, if there were a pattern, such as a bowl shape, we might consider another type of equation (such as quadratic) to model the data. "],"objNames":["wb_models_variance","wb_plot_residuals"]}
