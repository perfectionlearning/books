The sign of the charge must be included.  This means that the electric potential can be negative or positive.  This equation requires that the electric potential be zero at an infinite distance from the charge.","The electric potential at a point is the sum of the potentials at that point due to each of the charges.  The equation we show is for three charges, but it can be used for as many charges as you like.  Again, the sign of the charge must be included.
