The system of the paint bucket and Earth has potential energy, due to the force of <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_newton_equation_concept'>gravity<\/a> pulling the bucket and Earth toward each other.   ","Gravitational <i>PE<\/i> is proportional to three factors. First, the more massive the paint bucket, the more gravitational potential energy the system has at a given separation.  Again, you can think of the work required to change an object\u2019s energy. It takes more work to lift a 100-kilogram barbell to the top of a hill than to lift a 5-gram ping-pong ball. ","The amount of gravitational potential energy is also proportional to the height from the Earth\u2019s surface.  Again, you can think of work: The higher the paint bucket, the greater the displacement through which the lifting force was applied. ","The gravitational potential energy is proportional to <i>g<\/i>, the acceleration due to gravity.  One way to explain this: mg is the weight, the force of gravity.  The greater <i>g<\/i> is, the greater the weight. On a planet with greater freefall acceleration, such as Jupiter, the gravitational potential energy would be greater, all other factors being equal.","We have been carefully saying \u201cEarth-bucket system\u201d since the gravitational potential energy requires two masses.  Going ahead, to keep things briefer, we will often say things like \u201cthe gravitational <i>PE<\/i> of the bucket,\u201d and skip the reference to Earth."],"objNames":["wb_gravitational_PE_concept"]}
