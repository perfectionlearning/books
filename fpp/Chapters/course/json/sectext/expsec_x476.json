This enables it to store one <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_digital_bits'>bit</a> of information.","We start with “on.”  The gate voltage is the voltage applied to the gate electrode by the central wire.  When the gate voltage is zero, the transistor is “on.”  We show this in the upper diagram.","When a potential difference is applied across the wires on the left and right, represented with a minus and plus sign in the diagram, the conduction electrons in the <i>n</i>-type material, represented in green, are free to flow.  ","Now we discuss the “off” case. To turn the transistor off, a negative voltage is applied to the gate, as shown by the minus signs in the lower diagram. The resulting electric field drives electrons out of the <i>n</i>-type material of the channel into the <i>p</i>-type material of the substrate. The gate voltage creates a depletion zone in the channel, free of conducting electrons.

","When a potential difference is applied as before on the wires on the far left and right, current does not flow.  We say the transistor is “off,” just as we would say that a flashlight with an open switch is off."],"objNames":["wb_transistor2","wb_transistor3"]}
