","When the switch closes, the negative terminal pulls holes toward it, and the positive terminal pulls electrons toward it. The junction creates a wide depletion zone that is free of holes and conducting electrons. ","The greater the emf of the battery, the more it depletes this zone. The animation shows what would happen if the emf were to increase âˆ’ the depletion zone would become even more depleted. The zone forms a canyon across which charge cannot flow, so there is no continuing current.  This shows how diodes can prevent current flow."],"objNames":["wb_diode2"]}
