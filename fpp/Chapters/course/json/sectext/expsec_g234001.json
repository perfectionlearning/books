A magnetic train system could use solar or wind energy, converted to electricity, which is turned into electromagnetic fields that provide the force to levitate and propel trains.","For many proponents of this system, the possibility of \u201cgreen energy\u201d is the most important of the criteria for future transportation systems.  They place this at the top of society\u2019s needs. This is another example of science supplying data (about emissions) but other fields such as ethics and politics supplying the criteria for decisions.","Another force that opposes the motion of a train is air resistance.  Proposed hyperloop systems differ most dramatically from other train systems in this respect, because hyperloop trains would travel in a near-vacuum setting.  Less air means less air resistance, so less force is required to overcome drag forces and move the train along its tracks.  <br \/>","Even at a constant velocity, air resistance is a \u201cproblem,\u201d since as Newton said centuries ago, a body will continue at constant velocity unless it is acted upon by a net force.  If air resistance is present and opposing the motion, more propulsive force is required to ensure there is no net force acting on the train."],"objNames":["wb_hyperloop_definition","wb_magtrain_hyper"]}
