{"cards":[{"lines":[{"type":"title","text":"Conservation of energy"}]}],"definitions":[],"secText":["In this activity, you can use the law of energy conservation and your knowledge of potential and kinetic energies to help a soapbox derby car successfully make a jump.","In the diagram, you see a soapbox derby car with no engine. It gains speed as it rolls down a hill. You can drag the car to any point on the hill. A gauge will display the carâ€™s height above the ground. Release the car to let it roll down the hill.","In this activity, the goal is to have the car traveling at 12.5 m/s at the bottom of the ramp, to successfully jump through the hoop. Too slow and it will fall short, but too fast and it will hit the rim of the hoop.  Set the initial height appropriately, and the car will fly through the hoop."],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_7_22"]}
