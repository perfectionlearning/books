He says that any action − which we call a force on object A acting on object B − is met with an equal force in the opposite direction, which object B applies on object A.  ","In the illustration, you see someone leaning against the wall.  Newton’s third law tells you the wall is pushing back against the person with the same amount of force, in the opposite direction.","This combination of forces is sometimes called an action-reaction force pair. One object acts on another, and the other “reacts” with a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. "],"objNames":["wb_newton_third_law_definition"]}
