","We start with a diagram of pure silicon in equilibrium. Each silicon atom alone has four valence electrons. Eight electrons will fill the valence band. A silicon atom can fill its valence band by sharing electrons with its neighbors.","To explain conduction, we show an electron leaving the valence band and moving to the conduction band. As we discuss shortly, materials can be designed to have such holes, which then enable electrons to move through the material.  ","The missing electron creates what is called a \u201chole.\u201d  You can think of it as a hole that a mobile conducting electron might fill. Since it is created by the departure of an electron, the hole is positively charged.","From a semiconductor engineer\u2019s perspective, a hole is as real as an electron. Here we show a hole migrating from right to left. Electrons are moving from left to right. As an electron moves from one atom to the other, it leaves the hole in its wake. You see the hole \u201cflowing\u201d through the material, like a bubble in a fluid. "],"objNames":["wb_holes_2","wb_holes_3"]}
