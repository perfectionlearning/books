","We show a planet moving in an elliptical orbit around the Sun. Note that its speed is not constant. It moves slower when it is farther from the Sun and faster when it is closer.","Kepler\u2019s second law uses the concept of the area swept out by the line between the planet and the Sun. The pale yellow \u201cpie slice\u201d in the diagram indicates the area swept out during an interval of time. ","Kepler\u2019s second law states that along any portion of its orbit, a planet will sweep out an equal area in an equal amount of time. Because the sectors you see were swept out in equal amounts of time, their areas are equal. Kepler\u2019s laws can be proven using Newton\u2019s laws. ","We use the example of a planet that could be Earth or any planet orbiting the Sun.  The Earth\u2019s orbit is roughly circular \u2212 a circle is an ellipse, with its foci at the circle\u2019s center.  Kepler\u2019s second law applies to any satellite orbiting around any body. For instance, it applies to planets such as Jupiter, as well as Halley\u2019s Comet with its highly elliptical orbit of the Sun.   "],"objNames":["wb_kepler_second_law"]}
