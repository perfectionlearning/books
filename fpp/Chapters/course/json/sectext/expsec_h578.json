","We show a planet moving in an elliptical orbit around the Sun. Note that its speed is not constant. It moves slower when it is farther from the Sun and faster when it is closer.","Kepler’s second law uses the concept of the area swept out by the line between the planet and the Sun. The pale yellow “pie slice” in the diagram indicates the area swept out during an interval of time. ","Kepler’s second law states that along any portion of its orbit, a planet will sweep out an equal area in an equal amount of time. Because the sectors you see were swept out in equal amounts of time, their areas are equal. Kepler’s laws can be proven using Newton’s laws. ","We use the example of a planet that could be Earth or any planet orbiting the Sun, but Kepler’s second law applies to any satellite orbiting around any body, for example, Halley’s comet orbiting the Sun.
