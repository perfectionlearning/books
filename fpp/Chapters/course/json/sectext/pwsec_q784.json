It takes energy to turn the crank. This can be supplied by a human, or by energy unleashed by falling water, burning coal, or nuclear reactions.","In the lower diagram we show two views of the generator, the side view and an end view from behind the crank. We have removed the crank from the end view so that you can better see the wire loop. As the loop rotates, the wire that forms it moves in the magnetic field. ","As discussed earlier, moving a wire that is part of a circuit in a magnetic field induces an emf that causes a current in the circuit. We do not show the entire circuit, but the two leads opposite the crank conduct the current to where it can perform useful work.","The emf changes with the angle between the wire\u2019s motion and the magnetic field. When the horizontal segments move perpendicularly to the field, the flux is changing most rapidly, and the amount of induced emf is at a maximum. When they move parallel to the field, emf is at a minimum. The direction of the emf, and of the current it causes, changes as the wire loop rotates. The current will flow in one direction for half of every cycle of rotation, and in the other direction during the other half. "],"objNames":["wb_e_generator_concepts1","wb_e_generator_concepts2"]}
