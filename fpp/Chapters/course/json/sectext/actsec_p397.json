{"cards":[{"lines":[{"type":"title","text":"Parallel circuit"}]}],"definitions":[],"secText":["The circuit contains a battery and three light bulbs. The resistance of two of the light bulbs is known. Your task is to determine the resistance of the third light bulb.","The activity includes an ammeter that can be placed anywhere in the circuit to determine the current at that point. Use the ammeter, along with your knowledge of parallel circuits and Ohm’s law, to determine the resistance <i>R</i> of the light bulb. Calculating equivalent resistance of some of the resistors will be quite helpful in computing the unknown light bulb’s resistance. "],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_29_12"]}
