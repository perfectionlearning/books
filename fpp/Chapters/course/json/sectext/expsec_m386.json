Wavelength is a property specific to waves.","The wavelength is the distance between two equivalent points in a wave. It is easiest to measure this distance between two adjacent peaks or two adjacent troughs.","Wavelength is represented with the Greek letter, λ, pronounced “lambda.”  ","The table shows approximate wavelengths of a variety of mechanical and electromagnetic waves.  ","The values range from a few tenths of a nanometer for X-rays to 5 millimeters for bat sonar to an extraordinary hundreds of miles for a tsunami wave.
