Why do they react? The answer has to do with the electron configuration of the atoms or molecules.","Electrons near the center of an atom − called <i>core electrons</i> − are typically not involved in chemical reactions. ","It is the outer, higher-energy electrons, farther from the nucleus − called valence electrons − that usually determine what types of bonds an atom may form. In chemistry, valence is central to determining how an atom reacts chemically. Chemical reactions result in the loss, gain or rearrangement of these valence electrons. ","Regions where electrons exist are called shells. All atoms have shells of electrons surrounding a nucleus. The diagram shows core and valence electrons for sodium (Na). The single, outermost electron is its valence electrons.","As the diagram illustrates, the innermost shell can hold a maximum of two electrons. The next level shell can hold up to eight electrons. For the first eighteen elements, shell three can hold a maximum of eight electrons. (For elements with more electrons, shell three can hold more than eight, but that is a bit more complex and won’t be covered in these sections.)"],"objNames":["wb_valencechem_1b"]}
