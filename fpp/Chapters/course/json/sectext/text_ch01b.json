In the notebook, students may keep multiple sections, depending on your preferences. For example:","Reading Log: Have students preview the headers in each chapter, as well as any illustrations, photos, and interactions. Ask them to write a brief statement outlining what they already know about the topic. Next, ask them to write what they expect to learn, or what they\u2019d like to learn about the topic. Finally, after they\u2019ve completed a more thorough reading of the chapter, have them write a statement describing what they\u2019ve learned. They can also list any questions they have for you.","Vocabulary Definitions: Ask students to write a definition, in their own words, of the vocabulary words for each lesson. Then have them use the words in a sentence, paying careful attention to words that have different scientific meanings from more common usage.","Idea Bank: Encourage students to keep track of ideas, topics, people, and issues that they would like to learn more about. In this section, they can also list articles or books that they have found that may be used in future writing assignments.  This outside reading can also be used to further their understanding of a concept. Be sure they include bibliographic information of the articles or books in their notebooks. "],"objNames":[]}
