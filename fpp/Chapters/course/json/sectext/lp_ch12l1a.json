The [OBJ:expsec_l054:first law of thermodynamics] states that the change in thermal energy of a system is equal to the heat transferred to a system minus the work done by the system.<br />2. [OBJ:expsec_l055:Joule's experiment] proved the relationship between energy, heat, and work. A change of heat added to a system or work done by a system results in a change in the thermal energy of the system.","  <b>Vocabulary:</b>  [OBJ:expsec_l054:first law of thermodynamics]","  <b>STEM Skills:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1.
