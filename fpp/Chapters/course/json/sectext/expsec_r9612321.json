The bands occur because the path length difference is half a wavelength for them. Farther bands have path length differences of 1.5 times the wavelength, 2.5 times the wavelength, and so on.  The equation reflects this by adding <math><mrow><mfrac linethickness=\"thin\"><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></mrow></math> to the dark band number <i>m</i>.
