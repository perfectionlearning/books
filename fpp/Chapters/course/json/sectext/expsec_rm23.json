Concussions are an injury to the brain due to its rapid acceleration during collisions. They are often described as a bruise on the brain.  Multiple concussions can cause long-lasting damage to the brain, often described as dementia.  Athletes, including football players, sometimes suffer concussions.  ","In recent years, the topic of concussions in football and the effectiveness of football helmets have generated controversy.  Two groups, the National Football League (NFL) and the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment (NOCSAE), have been in the news with claims relating to the safety of the sport and the ratings of football helmets.  ","The NOCSAE standards continue to evolve and to be applied to more sports.  Their research and guidelines are on their website.   NOCSAE documents can be recognized by their blue and white symbol. Draft proposals are written in red and \u201cfinal status\u201d standards are written in black. ","You can find critiques and examinations of NOCSAE research and guidelines by entering \u201cNOCSAE critiques\u201d into a web browser.  They provide another perspective you can analyze."],"objNames":["wb_concussions1"]}
