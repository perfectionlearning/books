{"cards":[{"lines":[{"type":"title","text":"Wave superposition"}]}],"definitions":[],"secText":["In this unit, we discuss what happens when traveling waves combine with each other, as when waves meet on a string, in a pond, or even in a bathtub. Where they meet, the result can be higher peaks and lower troughs, or some canceling out that results in a smaller amplitude. ","In the simulation, you control two wave pulses traveling on the same string. One pulse starts on the left and moves right, and the other starts on the right and moves left. You determine the amplitude and width of each pulse, as well as whether it is a peak or a trough. Set the parameters for each pulse and press GO to see what happens when the pulses meet. If you want to see the pulses combining in slow motion, press the “time step” arrow to advance or reverse time in small increments.","A challenge for you: Can you set the pulses so that when they meet they exactly cancel each other out, causing the string to be completely flat for an instant?"],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_18_0_1"]}
