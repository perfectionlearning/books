Observers in different reference frames will disagree on an object’s velocity because they are moving relative to one another.    ","Fred is kicking a ball while standing on a train’s flatcar. From Fred’s point of view, the ball is moving at positive 10 m/s, and the train he is standing on is stationary.","An observer on the ground watching the train go by observes the soccer ball moving at a different velocity from what Fred observes. The observer, Sarah, measures that the train (and the man) has a velocity of <span class=\"math\">5 m/s</span> to the right relative to her. ","What is the velocity of the ball as measured by Sarah? In her reference frame, the train and man are moving at a velocity of <span class=\"math\">+5 m/s,</span> and the ball moves faster still. She adds velocity vectors to determine the relative velocity of the ball. Sarah measures the ball as moving at <span class=\"math\">15 m/s,</span> which equals the train’s <span class=\"math\">5 m/s</span> relative to her, plus the ball’s <span class=\"math\">10 m/s</span> relative to the train."],"objNames":["wb_relative_velocity1","wb_relative_velocity2"]}
