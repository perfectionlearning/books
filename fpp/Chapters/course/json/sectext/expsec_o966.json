The sphere will <b>induce</b> a charge, causing an object to be charged without contact.","Since electrons move to the far rod, it becomes negatively charged, and the nearby rod becomes positively charged. No electrons directly move between the sphere and the rods, but the charge on the sphere causes electrons to move within the rods.","The two rods are then separated, trapping the electrons that previously moved to the far rod, and trapping an excess of positive charge in the near rod. We show this in the lower illustration. Now one rod is negatively charged and the other is positively charged. The negatively charged sphere moves away, and the two rods now each have a net charge. The charged rods have been created without direct contact with the first charged object."],"objNames":["wb_induced_electric_concepts1","wb_induced_electric_concepts2"]}
