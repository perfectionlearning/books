The electrons in a current move slowly, or “lethargically” one might even say, to use an SAT word. ","When you flip the headlight switch on your car dashboard, a current starts and the headlights light up.  “Drift speed” describes the speed of the electron’s net motion as it moves along the wire. ","The charges move more slowly along the wire than you might think. In the wiring in a car’s electrical system, as shown here, the charges drift down the wire at about one-tenth of a millimeter per second. That is only 0.0002 miles per hour!","The light bulbs light up almost immediately because all of the electrons start moving at about the same time.  The electric field affects every electron, including those that are right next to the bulb. It is like a line of 150 people at a movie theater − the first person may enter quite soon when the doors open, while it takes a good amount of time for the last person to enter the theater. ","In a current-carrying wire, electrons do not move in a straight line. The individual electrons move very quickly, but collide with the atoms that make up the wire. The result is the zigzags that you see, which means a slow net motion for each electron, at the drift speed, along the wire. "],"objNames":["wb_drift_speed_concepts","wb_electric_zig_zag_concepts2"]}
