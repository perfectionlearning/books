","Artificial satellites, launched by rockets, also circle Earth in circular orbits. The speed of a satellite in circular orbit is constant. The direction of the velocity vector continuously changes since the direction of motion is always changing, but the magnitude of the velocity vector (the speed) does not. ","For an object orbiting under the influence of gravity, the speed and radius of the circular orbit are linked. A change in speed must result in a change in radius, and vice versa. A satellite in circular orbit cannot speed up or slow down and stay in the same orbital path. ","When the radius of a satelliteâ€™s orbit is smaller, it moves at a higher speed. In contrast, when the radius of the orbit is larger, the satellite moves more slowly."],"objNames":["wb_circular_orbit_concept1","wb_circular_orbit_concept2"]}
