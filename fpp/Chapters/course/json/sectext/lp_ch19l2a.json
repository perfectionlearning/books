The equation for [OBJ:expsec_s563:light intensity] is the same as the equation for sound intensity. To calculate light intensity, divide the power by the area of a sphere.<br />2. When light hits a surface, its electromagnetic waves are absorbed or reflected by the surface. This causes a transfer of momentum from the wave to the surface, [OBJ:expsec_s564:pushing] the wave and the surface away from each other.","  <b>Vocabulary:</b>  [OBJ:expsec_s563:intensity], [OBJ:expsec_s564:radiation pressure]","  <b>STEM Skills:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1.
