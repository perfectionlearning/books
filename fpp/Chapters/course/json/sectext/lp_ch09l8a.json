[OBJ:expsec_i980:Mechanical advantage] can be measured by dividing the force produced by the force applied. The [OBJ:expsec_i981:amount of work] done on the machine does not change the amount of work done by the machine.<br />3. The [OBJ:expsec_i982:efficiency of a machine] is measured by dividing the work output of the machine by the work input of the machine.","  <b>Vocabulary:</b>  [OBJ:expsec_i979:simple machine], [OBJ:expsec_i980:mechanical advantage], [OBJ:expsec_i982:efficiency]","  <b>STEM Skills:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1.
