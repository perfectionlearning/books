It has one proton and one neutron. The strong force holds these particles together, which means it takes energy to pry them apart. The total mass will change when the nucleus is disassembled. ","The energy required to rip apart a nucleus is called the \u201cbinding energy.\u201d It is the amount of energy that must be added to completely break apart the nucleus into the protons and neutrons that make it up, and it varies by element. For example, it takes 2.22 megaelectron volts to tear apart deuterium.  An electron volt is the work done to cause an electron to move through a potential difference of one volt.  ","Binding energy must be added to tear apart a nucleus, but this energy is not reflected in changes in kinetic energy or potential energy.  Instead, this energy goes to increasing the mass of the particles. We discuss the <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_emc2'>relationship of mass and energy<\/a> later.","The mass of the assembled deuterium nucleus is 2.01355 atomic mass units. (An atomic mass unit is based on carbon-12 atoms and equals about 1.66\u00d710<sup class=\"\">\u221227<\/sup> kilogram.)  The sum of the masses of the separated particles is 2.01594 atomic mass units. This means their mass increased by 0.00239 atomic mass units."],"objNames":["wb_nuclear_binding_energy_concepts2"]}
