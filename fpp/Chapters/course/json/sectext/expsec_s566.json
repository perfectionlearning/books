We begin our discussion of how they do this by explaining analog and digital signals.","Analog information is continuous.  Before computers, humans lived in an analog world.  The gauge we show in the first diagram displays values that are continuous.  The needle can point to any value. (In contrast, a digital display would show numbers such as 50.42.)","The visual and audio information we see and hear is continuous.  For instance, when you look through a window, the colors you see can be light of any frequency humans can see. ","When you speak, you are speaking \u201cin analog.\u201d  To put it another way, you can generate sound at any frequency, with any intensity, in the range possible for humans.  You produce a continuous wave, consisting of vibrating air particles, with the properties of that wave changing over time.  Your ears excel in interpreting this analog signal."],"objNames":["wb_analog1","wb_analog"]}
