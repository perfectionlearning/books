When stretched or compressed from equilibrium, or rest point, a spring produces a force that restores the spring to equilibrium.","You probably already know a few basic things about springs: You extend or stretch them, and they pull back on you. You compress or squeeze them, and they push back. ","Some springs are stiffer \u2212 harder to stretch or compress \u2212 than others.  The spring constant is a number given to a spring that describes how stiff it is.  A large constant means a stiff spring \u2212 one that is hard to stretch or compress. ","The magnitude of the spring\u2019s force is proportional to how far a spring is displaced from its rest position.  As it is stretched or compressed, the amount of force increases. ","The equation says the force is the product of the spring constant and the displacement from the rest point. ","The spring force is a restoring force \u2212 one that pushes or pulls back to a rest point. It always points in the opposite direction of the displacement.  The negative sign in the equation shows that the force is in the opposite direction of the displacement."],"objNames":["wb_hooke_concept","wb_hooke_equation"]}
