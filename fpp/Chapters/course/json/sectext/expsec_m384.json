","When we track the location of an individual particle in the wave using the red circle, we see it moves in simple harmonic motion.  The example shows a transverse wave, but the same holds true for longitudinal waves.","As should be expected with SHM, the particle moves fastest at the midpoint of its motion, and slowest at the extremes.
