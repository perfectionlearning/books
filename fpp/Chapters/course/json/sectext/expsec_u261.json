","We show how a car refracted as it moved from dry pavement to ice. When it made this transition, some of its wheels were on ice while the others were on dry pavement.  The left side of the car moved more quickly on the dry pavement than the right side, which is on ice, and the car rotated.","The rotation caused the car to change direction.  Then when all four wheels are on the ice, the car once again moves in a straight line."],"objNames":["wb_why_refraction_concepts1"]}
