They are two distinct concepts.","Precision says how exact or repeatable a measurement can be. A micrometer might measure to the hundredth or thousandth of  a centimeter, which is more precise than a ruler, which might only have the precision of a tenth of a centimeter.","Accuracy has no relation to precision. Accuracy means how close to the true value a measurement is.  The three clocks in the second diagram may be precise to the nearest minute, but at least one clock is not accurate.","The tools you will use in lab have different amounts of precision and accuracy.  For instance, you may have a caliper to measure lengths.  It may be precise to 0.1 millimeter or be even better.  "],"objNames":["wb_precision_accuracy_concepts","wb_precision_accuracy_concepts1a"]}
