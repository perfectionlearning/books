It causes particles to attract or repel one another."}],"secText":["The study of electricity begins with charge.    Electric charge is a basic idea needed to understand electric forces and electricity. You observe a property of electric charge, electric force, dramatically in lightning and in everyday life in the “static cling” that your clothes gain in a dryer. The photograph shows a property of electric charge: the electric force between like charges that causes them to repel one another. ","In the second diagram, you see the two fundamental particles that possess charge, an electron and a proton. Charges come in two kinds, “negative” and “positive.” Electrons have a negative charge, shown by a minus sign on the black electron. Protons have a positive charge, indicated with a plus sign on the red proton.","A proton has the same amount of charge as an electron, but with the opposite sign.  Sum up the charges of an electron and of a proton, and you get zero."],"objNames":["wb_charge_concepts1","wb_charge_concepts"]}
