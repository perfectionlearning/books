Nuclear bombs and nuclear reactors are two results of this knowledge.   ","Unstable, massive nuclei such as uranium-236 split into smaller pieces in a process called fission. What happens during the fission process?","Some models of the nucleus liken it to a droplet of superdense liquid. Fission corresponds to vigorous vibrations of the droplets, which then split in two. The nucleus divides into smaller pieces, including new elements that are more stable. Energy is released as well.","The fission process often releases neutrons. Heavier nuclei have more neutrons than protons, while lighter nuclei have roughly equal numbers of neutrons and protons. This means there are usually some neutrons left over after a heavy nucleus breaks into lighter nuclei.","The number of nucleons does not change during fission. In our example, there are 236 nucleons before and after. However, the mass of the fission products is less than the original mass of the U-236 nucleus. Some of the original mass is transformed into an equivalent amount of energy that is released during the fission process, for example, as radiation."],"objNames":["wb_fission_concepts1"]}
