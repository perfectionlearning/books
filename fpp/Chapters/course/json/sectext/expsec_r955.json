In the top graph, we show waves A and B with no phase difference.  Peak matches up with peak, and trough matches trough.  Note that the two waves have the same wavelength. These waves have a 0-degree phase difference, a description that comes from trigonometry. ","When waves A and B have a 180-degree phase difference, peak overlaps trough, and trough overlaps peak.  ","We also show waves A and B with a 90-degree phase difference. They are not totally in phase \u2212 with peak meeting peak \u2212 or out of phase \u2212 where peak meets trough. ","Phase differences range over all possible angles, with the angles 0 and 360 degrees indicating no phase difference and maximum constructive interference. Other phase angles such as positive or negative 180 degrees result in maximum destructive difference."],"objNames":["wb_interference_intro1"]}
