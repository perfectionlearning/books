We show the equation for calculating the potential energy stored in a spring. The potential energy is the same as the work done by you on the spring, as you stretch or compress it. We graph how the potential energy changes with displacement. It is a parabola, as one would expect with a squared term in the equation.    "],"objNames":["wb_elastic_PE_definition","wb_PE_spring"]}
