","AM radio waves have frequencies ranging from 530 kHz to 1,710 kHz, with wavelengths ranging from 566 meters to 175 meters. AM radio stations announce their frequencies in kilohertz: \u201c710 AM on your radio dial\u201d means a frequency of 710 kHz. FM radio waves have higher frequencies and shorter wavelengths than AM radio waves. ","The government regulates who can use what frequencies. For instance, it wants to ensure a garage door opener does not interfere with a cellphone, or, someone\u2019s wi-fi router doesn\u2019t open the neighbor\u2019s garage door. The frequencies used by radio stations were chosen in the first days of radio when the abilities to broadcast and receive transmissions were fairly limited. Some choices of \u201cwho\u201d got what frequency are based on history \u2212 AM radio was developed before FM radio, so it got the lower frequencies. ","Cellphones use parts of the electromagnetic spectrum to communicate as well.  Higher frequencies can deliver more data \u2212 roughly speaking, the greater frequency allows more times per second for a signal to be encoded.  On the other hand, the higher frequencies do not travel through buildings as well, so the user may not receive an \u201cinvaluable\u201d text or video stream as easily. ","Visible light has far higher frequencies than radio signals, ranging from over 400 trillion Hz for red light to almost 800 trillion Hz for violet light. Wavelengths of light are often expressed in nanometers: The wavelength of red light is around 650 nanometers. Everything you see in the world is brought to you by electromagnetic radiation \u2212 light \u2212 in this frequency range.  <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_double_slit_white_concepts'>\u201cWhite\u201d<\/a> light consists of a mixture of all the visible light frequencies. The photosynthesis process of plants most effectively processes light in the 450 and 650 nanometer ranges. "],"objNames":["wb_electromagnetic_spectrum2","wb_electromagnetic_spectrum3"]}
