We have done this earlier, such as discuss the relationship of <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_gravitational_PE_concept'>work and an object\u2019s gravitational potential energy<\/a>. ","Work done on a system changes its energy. This is called the <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_work_potentialequation'>work-energy theorem<\/a>.  We use the example of an elevator and its passengers.  To be more specific, our system includes the Earth, since the planet is a required element of the system\u2019s gravitational potential energy.  ","The elevator and its passengers start on the ground and are pulled up by the cable.  The cable is doing positive work on the elevator car, applying a force through a displacement that is in the same direction.  The cable\u2019s work increases both the gravitational potential energy and the kinetic energy of the car and its passengers.","Work can also reduce a system\u2019s energy. Here, a force, <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_friction_definition'>friction<\/a>, acts toward the right and opposes the motion of the block that is sliding to the left.  Friction is doing negative work on the block, slowing it down.","The work that is done is negative work, since the force is in the opposite direction of the displacement. The negative work on the object reduces its energy.   "],"objNames":["wb_work_on_system_and_energy_add","wb_work_on_system_and_energy_subtract"]}
