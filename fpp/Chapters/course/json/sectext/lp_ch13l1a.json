[OBJ:expsec_m355:Simple harmonic motion] is the movement of an object in a repeated pattern. In simple harmonic motion, the restoring force points toward equilibrium.<br />2. The [OBJ:expsec_m356:cycle] of an object in simple harmonic motion returns the object to its initial state.<br />3. The [OBJ:expsec_m358:amplitude] of an object in simple harmonic is the maximum distance the object is from equilibrium.<br />4. The [OBJ:expsec_m360:period] of an object in simple harmonic motion is the amount of time it takes to complete one cycle.<br />5. The [OBJ:expsec_m362:frequency] of an object in simple harmonic motion is the number of cycles per second that an object completes.<br />6. An object in simple harmonic motion can be [OBJ:actsec_m361:graphed] as a position-time graph. Using the position-time graph, the amplitude, period, and frequency of the object can be calculated.","  <b>Vocabulary:</b>  [OBJ:expsec_m355:simple harmonic motion (SHM)], [OBJ:expsec_m355:restoring force], [OBJ:expsec_m356:cycle], [OBJ:expsec_m358:amplitude], [OBJ:expsec_m360:period], [OBJ:expsec_m362:frequency]","  <b>STEM Skills:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1.
