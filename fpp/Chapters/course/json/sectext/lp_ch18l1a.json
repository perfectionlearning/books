[OBJ:expsec_r954:Interference] is the result of overlapping waves. Examples of interference are waves combining and color. Wave sources for interference can be [OBJ:expsec_r959:coherent and incoherent]. Light waves combine to create [OBJ:expsec_r959111:light interference patterns].<br />2. [OBJ:expsec_r957:Constructive interference] is represented by the bright bands in light interference patterns. Constructive interference is when two waves combine to create one wave with greater amplitude than the two individual waves. [OBJ:expsec_r960:Destructive interference] is represented by the dark bands in light interference patterns. Destructive interference is when two waves combine to create one with a lesser amplitude than the two individual waves.<br />3. Constructive interference has a [OBJ:expsec_r955:phase difference] of 0 degrees. Destructive interference has a phase difference of 180 degrees.<br />4. There is no difference in the [OBJ:expsec_r967:path length] between waves in constructive interference. There is a half a wavelength difference between path lengths in destructive interference.","  <b>Vocabulary:</b>  [OBJ:expsec_r954:interference], [OBJ:expsec_r959:coherent wave source], [OBJ:expsec_r957:constructive interference], [OBJ:expsec_r960:destructive interference], [OBJ:expsec_r955:phase difference]","  <b>STEM Skills:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1.
