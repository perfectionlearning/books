He pioneered studies in areas ranging from light to gravity.  He also invented, or co-invented, the mathematical field of calculus. ","We focus on Newtonâ€™s three laws of force.  Two of the laws show the relationship between force and acceleration.  These three laws are still fundamental to science today, and are named after their discoverer.
