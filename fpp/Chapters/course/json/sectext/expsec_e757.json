He pioneered studies in areas ranging from light to gravity.  He also invented, or co-invented, the mathematical field of  calculus. His mathematical abilities were crucial to his scientific discoveries.  His approach to science also differed from that of the ancient Greeks, whose theories he challenged.  Newton started with meticulous observations  and used mathematics to construct his laws. ","We focus on Newton\u2019s three laws of force.  Two of the laws show the relationship between force and acceleration.  These three laws are still fundamental to science today, and are named after their discoverer.  In addition, the unit for force is the newton, named after Sir Isaac.","Newton\u2019s laws apply for speeds that he (and we) experience every day, such as a falling apple for Newton, or the motion of a car or plane for us.  As the scientist Albert Einstein explained centuries later, as speeds approach the speed of light, Newton\u2019s laws supply a limiting case.  Properties such as mass, length and time must be considered differently at such high speeds.
