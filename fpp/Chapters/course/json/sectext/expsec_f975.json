","Energy is always conserved.  By “conserved,” we mean that it remains constant. Energy cannot “disappear” or be “magically” created.  The total amount of energy must stay the same.  ","The total energy of an isolated system stays constant − it is conserved. By an isolated system, we mean an object, or group of objects, that is not having energy transferred into or out of it.    The opposite of an isolated system is an open system, where energy (or mass) can enter or exit the system. ","For instance, as the boy swings up and down, the total energy of the system stays the same.  It may be all potential energy when he is standing on the cliff.","At the bottom of his swing, it is all kinetic energy. As he swings back and forth, potential energy may be changing into kinetic energy, and vice versa.  ","The key point is that the total energy of the system stays the same.  If we add it up, we will always get the same amount.  Scientists (and you, we hope) say that energy is conserved.   We should note that in extreme conditions, such as fusion within the Sun, we have to talk about mass-energy conservation, because Einstein’s <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_emc2'>theory of relativity</a> tells us that mass and energy are interchangeable. But for everyday matters, such as the boy on the swing we show, energy is conserved. "],"objNames":["wb_conservation_energy_concept"]}
