Mathematical signs are required to use mirror equations because they indicate factors such as what side of a mirror an image appears on, whether it is inverted, and so on.","We use the subscript o for object and i for image in the equations. Positive <i>d<\/i><sub class=\"\">i<\/sub> means that the image is real. For a mirror, a real image is on the same side as the object. ","If the sign of <i>d<\/i><sub class=\"\">i<\/sub> is negative, it means that the image is virtual. For a mirror, the image is on the opposite side from the object, which has a positive distance.  For example, the image formed by the plane mirror is virtual and the image distance will be negative. Although we do not discuss this case in this textbook, an image formed by one lens or mirror can become the object for another lens or mirror, meaning that objects can be virtual and have a negative object distance.","If the image is \u201cright side up\u201d \u2212 or upright \u2212 then the sign for the image height will be positive. If the image is \u201cupside down\u201d \u2212 or inverted \u2212 then the sign for the image height is negative. The image formed by a plane mirror is upright, and the image formed by the concave mirror in the lower diagram is inverted.  "],"objNames":["wb_mirror_signs1","wb_mirror_signs2"]}
