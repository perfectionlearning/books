","When the force is parallel to the displacement (and in the same direction), the work equals the product of the amount of force and the amount of displacement.  The magnitude of the force is assumed to be constant. ","If the force is in the opposite direction from the displacement, then the work done on the object will be negative, since the two vectors have opposite directions. ","Work and energy share a unit: the joule, pronounced like \u201cjewel.\u201d  As you can see, a joule is the product of a kilogram and meter squared, divided by second squared.  You can double-check our work if you like: multiply the unit for force by the unit for displacement. The abbreviation for the joule is capital J.
