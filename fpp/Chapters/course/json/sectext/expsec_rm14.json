Einstein\u2019s brilliant theorizing was matched by a brilliant experiment to test his ideas.   ","Einstein studied the relationship of light and gravity.  His hypothesis predicted that gravity should bend light by an amount twice as great as that predicted by older theories.  His prediction seemed hard to test, since a great amount of gravity was required for a noticeable result.  ","Scientists, led by the British scientist Sir Arthur Eddington, had the creativity to realize that they could use the natural phenomenon of a solar eclipse to observe starlight passing near the Sun\u2019s surface.  Not only could they see if light was bent, but they could also test if the theory of general relativity correctly predicted how much it was bent.  When they made their observations at different locations, off the coast in Africa and in Brazil, they found that Einstein\u2019s theory correctly predicted the bending of the light.  ","Einstein\u2019s theory relied on earlier science. For instance, he and others knew what was meant by \u201cgravity\u201d as it was developed by Sir Isaac Newton. Sir Isaac Newton mostly worked in the 17<sup class=\"\">th<\/sup> century, but he understood even in his century that he relied on others.
