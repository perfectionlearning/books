	"Einstein’s general theory of relativity provides a case study − an example − of the process of science. Einstein’s brilliant theorizing was matched by a brilliant experiment to test his ideas.", 
	"Einstein studied the relationship of light and gravity. His hypothesis predicted that gravity should bend light by an amount twice as great as that predicted by older theories. His prediction seemed hard to test, since a great amount of gravity was required for a noticeable result.", 
	"Scientists, led by the British scientist Sir Arthur Eddington, had the creativity to realize that they could use the natural phenomenon of a solar eclipse to observe starlight passing near the Sun’s surface. Not only could they see if light was bent, but they could also test if the theory of general relativity correctly predicted how much it was bent. When they made their observations at different locations, off the coast in Africa and in Brazil, they found that Einstein’s theory correctly predicted the bending of the light.", 
	"Einstein’s theory relied on earlier science. For instance, he and others knew what was meant by “gravity” as it was developed by Sir Isaac Newton. Sir Isaac Newton mostly worked in the 17<sup>th</sup> century, but he understood even in his century that he relied on others. He modestly wrote: “If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.”"
