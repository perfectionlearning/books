Einstein’s work was crucial to developing other theories as new areas of science developed − in this case, the relationship of light and gravity.  His theory predicted that gravity should bend light by an amount twice as great as that predicted by older theories.  That seemed hard to test (since the amount of gravity had to be great).  ","Scientists realized that they could use the natural phenomenon of a solar eclipse to observe starlight passing near the Sun’s surface.  Not only could they see if light was bent, but they could also test if the theory of general relativity correctly predicted how much it was bent.  When they made their observations, they found that Einstein’s theory correctly predicted the bending of the light.  ","Einstein’s theory relied on earlier science. For instance, he and others knew what was meant by “gravity” as it was developed by Sir Isaac Newton. Sir Isaac Newton mostly worked in the 17<sup class=\"\">th</sup> century, but he understood even in his century that he relied on others.  He modestly wrote: “If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.<span class=\"apple-style-span\">”</span>"],"objNames":["wb_general_rel"]}
