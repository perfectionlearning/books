Metalloids include semiconductors such as silicon and germanium. Semiconductors conduct electricity under certain conditions. Semiconductors are essential in microprocessors and computer memory chips. As you may be noting, columns alone cannot explain all the properties of elements.","Nonmetals (highlighted in blue) are poor conductors of heat and electricity. If they are solids, they tend to be brittle. They cannot be stretched or formed. In short, many of their properties are the opposite of those of metals! They can be solids, liquids or gases at room temperature. ","The two far right columns contain the noble gases<i>.</i> They are odorless, colorless and not very reactive. The gases have low boiling and melting points, which makes them useful as extremely low-temperature refrigerants."],"objNames":["wb_periodictablephysicalproperties_5","wb_periodictablephysicalproperties_6"]}
