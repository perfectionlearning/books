We will start by discussing average velocity.","We use average velocity in everyday speech.  If someone says, \u201cI drove from Seattle to Spokane at 60 miles per hour,\u201d they are stating an average velocity.  Their car was not moving exactly at 60 miles per hour at every instant.","To calculate the average velocity of a trip, we calculate the <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_displacement_equation'>displacement<\/a> of the car during the entire trip, which in our example is negative 170 meters.  The elapsed time is 10 seconds.  Dividing negative 170 meters by 10 seconds, we get negative 17 meters per second.   ","Average velocity of an object equals its displacement divided by the elapsed time.
