Another scientist, Louis de Broglie, showed the converse was true for matter. He showed that matter could be shown to have properties that we associate with waves. ","De Broglie was a French physics graduate student when he hypothesized a fundamental symmetry in nature. He agreed that matter has the properties of a particle, a view you may well share.  This is the classical view of matter, which we used in discussing topics such as Newton\u2019s laws or projectile motion. ","De Broglie argued that matter also had wavelike properties. He reasoned that Einstein had shown that light, which had been thought of solely as a wave, also had particle properties. Why, creatively questioned de Broglie, should matter not also have wave properties? ","De Broglie\u2019s hypothesis deserves emphasis. An electron has mass, as the tables in any physics book will indicate, and when it is moving, an electron has momentum. These are properties of particles. However, de Broglie\u2019s hypothesis, later confirmed with experiments, was that matter also exhibits behavior that we associate with waves, such as diffraction and interference.
