{"cards":[{"lines":[{"type":"title","text":"Motional induction"}]}],"definitions":[],"secText":["In this activity, you can drag a wire left and right, perpendicular to a magnetic field. If your efforts induce an emf, current will flow and the light bulb will light.","Conduct some experiments: Drag the wire slowly, and then drag it very fast. Does the speed of the wire through the magnetic field affect the amount of potential difference across the light bulb? How do the two relate? How does changing the direction of the wire motion change the direction of the current? How does it change the potential difference?","You can also use the magnetic field strength control to make the magnetic field in the simulation stronger (or weaker, or even oppositely directed). Does changing the field strength change the results of your efforts?","To help you to answer these questions, the simulation has an oscilloscope that measures the potential difference across the light bulb. The oscilloscope in this simulation is functionally similar to a real-world model. You can change the output scale by clicking on its dial."],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_32_2"]}
