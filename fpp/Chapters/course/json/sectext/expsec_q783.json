    "Earlier, we showed a wire moving in an external magnetic field, as shown again in the diagram. We also showed the direction of the current. In this section, we confirm that direction using <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_Lenz_law_concepts2'>Lenz’s law</a>. ",
    "When the wire slides to the right as shown, the motion increases the magnetic flux due to the external field, since the area enclosed by the rectangular circuit increases. (If the wire were moving in the opposite direction, the flux would be decreasing in magnitude, since the area would be decreasing.) Here, we show only the orientation of the external magnetic field. ",
    "The induced magnetic field due to the current opposes the change in external flux. Since that flux is increasing, the induced field does this by pointing in the direction opposite to the external field. The induced field points toward you as shown. ",
    "The right-hand rule for currents confirms that the current moves upward along the moving wire: Your fingers point toward you inside the rectangle, so your thumb points up on the right side, which is the direction of the current there. The current goes counterclockwise around the circuit."
