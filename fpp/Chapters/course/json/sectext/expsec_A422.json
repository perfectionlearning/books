It is a particle needed to explain the masses of other particles."}],"secText":["An essential ingredient of the Standard Model is a particle called the Higgs boson.","The Higgs boson was the goal of a decades-long search, as it is the key to the origin of particle mass. In the 2012-2013 period, experimenters at the CERN accelerator announced that they had found a particle whose properties were very consistent with the expected properties of the Higgs boson.  The discovery of the particle provided perhaps a final piece in confirming the theory of the Standard Model, backing up other related phenomenon discovered by scientists.","The discovery is another testimony to the international nature of scientific investigation.  The CERN accelerator is located on the French\/Swiss border and is a collaboration of 22 countries. It is the successor to the Fermi accelerator in the United States, where some of the initial research was conducted. Peter Higgs is a British physicist. He won the Nobel prize in physics in 2013 along with Francois Englert of France.  <br \/><br \/><br \/>They did their work independently, arriving at the same outcome, and were awarded the Nobel Prize (from the institution based in Sweden), illustrating how international consensus plays a key role in science.  Higgs and Englert\u2019s creativity supplied the insights, and teams of other scientists, with the skills in engineering and computer science necessary to run an accelerator, confirmed the results."],"objNames":["wb_standard_model5"]}
