Grass seeds show the direction of the field, with the field emphasized by the yellow lines. ","Each yellow line points toward one of the charges.  A positive test charge would be attracted to the negative charges.  ","At the midpoint between the two charges, you see the seeds are less common, and there is no clear orientation to them.  ","Why?  Consider a positive test charge directly between the two negative charges.  It would be pulled in opposite directions by equal amounts of force, and there would be no net force.  In other words, the sum of the electric fields is zero at the midpoint, and it is weak at nearby points.   "],"objNames":["wb_multiple_fields_concepts3"]}
