","At slower speeds, a rocket may fall back to the planet from which it is launched, or enter an orbit around the planet (which means that it has not escaped). At very high speeds, a rocket can escape the pull of the planet’s gravity altogether. The lowest speed that just barely allows that is called the escape speed.","The escape speed increases as the planet’s mass increases, proportional to the square root of the planet’s mass.  Also, the escape speed is inversely proportional to the square root of a planet’s radius. "],"objNames":["wb_escape_speed_concept","wb_escape_speed_equation"]}
