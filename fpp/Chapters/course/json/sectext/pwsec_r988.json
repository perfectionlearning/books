What makes up a color is based on human judgment. For instance, over time, people have divided the spectrum into a different number of colors, with some including the color “indigo” as a separate color, and others not.  Reference sources also differ about the exact wavelengths that make up red versus orange.  ","In the upper diagram you see a spectrum of colors.  When these colors are combined, we perceive the combination as white light. ","Using a prism, Sir Isaac Newton demonstrated that white light is a combination of all the colors.  The prism splits light into its component wavelengths by means of refraction. ","Light can be separated using a prism.  It can also be combined, as any painter as young as a kindergartener knows. For instance, combining blue and yellow creates green."],"objNames":["wb_color_essentials","wb_combining_colors"]}
