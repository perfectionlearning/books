The diagram shows Earth\u2019s external magnetic field. ","Anyone who has ever used a compass has taken advantage of the fact that Earth is a huge magnet. Earth\u2019s magnetic field determines the direction of a compass needle. ","Earth\u2019s magnetic south pole is located very close to what we call the North Pole. Before magnets were well understood, scientists decided that the \u201cnorth\u201d end of a compass needle should point toward the North Pole. Since opposites attract, the geographic North Pole of our planet is in fact close to its magnetic south pole.","On the other hand, a location near Earth\u2019s geographic South Pole is a magnetic north pole. The south end of a compass needle points approximately toward the geographic South Pole. Earth\u2019s magnetic poles wander over time, and approximately every hundred thousand years they rather suddenly change places.  So one day south will in fact be south! The orientation of the Sun\u2019s magnetic field changes as well, but far more often. The Sun\u2019s poles trade places about every 11 years, with one such change occurring in late 2013."],"objNames":["wb_earth_b_fields_concepts"]}
