The diagram shows Earth’s external magnetic field. ","Anyone who has ever used a compass has taken advantage of the fact that Earth is a huge magnet. Earth’s magnetic field determines the direction of a compass needle. ","Earth’s magnetic south pole is located very close to what we call the North Pole. Before magnets were well understood, scientists decided that the “north” end of a compass needle should point toward the North Pole. Since opposites attract, the geographic North Pole of our planet is in fact close to its magnetic south pole.","On the other hand, a location near Earth’s geographic South Pole is a magnetic north pole. The south end of a compass needle points approximately toward the geographic South Pole. Earth’s magnetic poles wander over time, and approximately every hundred thousand years they rather suddenly change places.  So one day south will in fact be south! The orientation of the Sun’s magnetic field changes as well, but far more often. The Sun’s poles trade places about every 11 years, with one such change occurring in late 2013."],"objNames":["wb_earth_b_fields_concepts"]}
