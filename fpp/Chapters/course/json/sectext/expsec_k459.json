In an ideal gas, molecules are separated by space that is huge compared to the size of the molecules. In the illustration, the molecules are of course drawn larger than reality, but they are also far larger than they would be relative to the typical distances between them in an ideal gas. The small number of molecules is intended to represent the relatively vast amount of space surrounding any molecule.","The gas is made up of hundreds of billions or trillions, or an even larger number, of molecules that <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_elastic_collision_defined'>collide elastically<\/a> with each other and with the walls of the container.
