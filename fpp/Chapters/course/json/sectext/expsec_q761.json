    "We show the equation for the magnitude of the force on a moving charge, when the velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field.  It is the product of the charge, the speed, and the strength of the magnetic field. ",

The force on a negative charge is in the opposite direction of the force on a positive charge.",
