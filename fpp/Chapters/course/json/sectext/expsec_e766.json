","Gravity is pulling the block down onto the floor.  If the floor did not push back, the block would pass through the floor. The normal force from the floor, acting on the block, prevents this from happening. You experience the normal force as you walk across a floor. ","The contact surface is where the two objects touch each other. The normal force is always perpendicular to the contact surface.  (That is one meaning of normal − perpendicular.)  As you can see in the case of the person leaning on the wall, normal forces do not have to be vertical.   "],"objNames":["wb_normal_force_definition","wb_normal_force_direction"]}
