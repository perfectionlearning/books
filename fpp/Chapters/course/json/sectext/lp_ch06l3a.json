There are many different forms of [OBJ:expsec_f961:energy], such as chemical, kinetic, potential, and electric. Work changes the amount of energy of an object.<br />2. [OBJ:expsec_f962:Kinetic energy] is the energy of motion of an object. The kinetic energy of an object can be calculated by multiplying an object's mass by its velocity squared divided by 2.<br />3. The [OBJ:expsec_f964:net amount of work] is equal to the change in kinetic energy of an object.
