It gets its name from its resemblance to how optical lenses change the direction of light. ","One prediction of Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity is that gravity changes the direction of light.  Gravitational lensing is evidence of that. ","The change in direction of light produces images at locations that differ from the actual location of the object.  The diagram shows the gravitational lensing caused by a cluster of galaxies.  The cluster\u2019s gravity pulls together the light rays emitted by a distant object, and an observer on Earth sees two or more images of the distant object, on either side of the true location."],"objNames":["wb_gravitational_lensing_concepts"]}
