Tools such as spreadsheets and calculators can perform this task.  They produce a line that provides the best linear model for the data. ","The coefficient of determination is a measure of how well the trend line “fits” the data. It has values between 0 and 1. ","The coefficient of determination is usually indicated as <i>r</i><sup class=\"\">2</sup>. The closer <i>r</i><sup class=\"\">2</sup> is to 1, the better the model equation could describe the data. The coefficient is a good way to communicate whether a hypothesis is correct and to quantify the effects of uncertainty (error) in measurements. ","In the second diagram, the graph shows data about the relationship between the electric resistance and the length of a wire. The graph shows an extremely high correlation between resistance and length.  The graph on the right shows the Dow Jones average, an average of stock prices, as the dependent variable. This trend line has a very low coefficient of determination, less than 0.1.  The year is a poor predictor of stock prices."],"objNames":["wb_regression1","wb_regression2"]}
