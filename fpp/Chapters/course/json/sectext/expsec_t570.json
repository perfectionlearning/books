Here, we perform the same task for a convex mirror.","With this form of a mirror, the first ray starts parallel to the mirrorâ€™s axis and reflects upward, moving directly away from the focal point that is behind the mirror. We continue the reflected ray back through the mirror as a virtual ray and show that it passes through the focal point on the far side. ","Ray 2 starts off headed toward the focal point behind the mirror. It strikes the mirror before it reaches the focal point and reflects parallel to the principal axis. The virtual extension of the reflected ray as a dashed line is parallel to the principal axis.","Ray 3 heads toward the center of curvature. After ray 3 hits the mirror, it heads back in the direction from which it came. We again draw a virtual ray extended backward from the reflected ray. The virtual ray passes through the center of curvature.","We draw the image of the penguin so its head is at the intersection of the virtual rays. The image is upright, smaller than the object, and virtual. In other words, it is right side up, smaller, and on the opposite side of the mirror from the object. This is the type of image of your own face that you see in a shiny holiday tree ball."],"objNames":["wb_convex_mirror_concepts2","wb_convex_mirror_concepts5"]}
