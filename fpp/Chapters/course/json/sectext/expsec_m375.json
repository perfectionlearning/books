The person\u2019s force acts in the direction of the motion.","The result of well-timed pushes is that the child goes higher and higher. The amplitude of the motion increases when the frequency of the external force is the same, or about the same, as that of the system it is acting on.  The external force\u2019s frequency is called the \u201cdriving frequency.\u201d ","The natural frequency is determined by physical factors of a system.  In this case, it includes factors such as the length of the swing\u2019s rope and Earth\u2019s freefall acceleration.  When the frequency of the driving force matches a natural frequency, it increases the amplitude of the motion.  This is called \u201cresonance.\u201d"],"objNames":["wb_resonance1"]}
