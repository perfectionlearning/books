To begin your study of refraction, try this section’s submarine-stalking activity.  Each of your helicopters can fire a laser at any of three submarines lurking under the sea. ","The submarines have lasers, too, and will shoot back at your craft. Your mission is to disable the submarines before they disarm your helicopters.","You play by dragging the aiming arrow underneath any one of your helicopters. Press FIRE and the laser beam will follow the direction of this arrow until it reaches the water, where refraction will cause the beam to change direction.","Observe how the light bends at the boundary when the laser beam strikes the water. How does its direction change?  You can also observe how refraction differs when a laser beam passes from air to water (your lasers) and from water to air (the submarines’ lasers)."],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_36_0"]}
