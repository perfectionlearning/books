","This diagram shows a long, thin wire with a current running through it. The strength of the magnetic field around that wire increases as the current increases.","Conversely, the field strength decreases with distance from the wire. The magnetic field diagram reflects this fact since the circles are farther apart at increased distances from the wire. Remember, the distance between field lines reflects the strength of the field, so where the lines are farther apart, the field is weaker.","The magnetic field at a distance <i>R<\/i> from the wire can be calculated with the equation you see here.
