Many engines involve heat."}],"secText":["One reason that thermodynamics is so important is that scientists use it to model engines.","Engines use energy to do work.  A gasoline engine uses the chemical energy contained in gasoline to push a car forward. An old-fashioned steam engine used heat released from burning wood to do the same. If you are pedaling a bicycle, you are using your bodyâ€™s chemical energy to spin the bicycle crank. ","Many engines use heat as their energy source.  The ignition of gasoline within a car engine provides the heat source that powers it. Another example is the engine of a nuclear-powered submarine, which uses the heat released by radioactive decay as its power source.","Engines have cycles, repeating through the same states over and over again.  A cycle starts and ends with the same volume, pressure, and thermal energy.  ","No engine can be perfectly efficient, which means no engine can convert 100% of the heat energy supplied to it into work.  Some energy, which we model as heat flowing out of the engine, does not go to doing work."],"objNames":["wb_engine_concept1"]}
