{"cards":[{"lines":[{"type":"title","text":"Experimenting with circular motion"}]}],"definitions":[],"secText":["When a child riding on a carousel or a person riding on a Ferris wheel reaches a constant rate of rotation, she moves in a circle at a constant <b>speed</b>. In physics, this is called uniform circular motion.","Although the car moves at a constant speed as it moves around the curve, it is accelerating. This is called centripetal acceleration. It is accelerating because its direction of motion is changing, which means its velocity is changing.  ","This can be seen in the simulation: The magnitude of the velocity vector, which is the speed, stays constant, but its direction continuously changes as the car moves. In the simulation, this is shown by the fact that at a constant speed, the velocity vector’s length stays the same, but its direction changes. ","The simulation has gauges for the <span class=\"math\"><i>x-</i></span> and <span class=\"math\"><i>y</i></span>-components of the car’s velocity.  Some questions for you:  Do the gauges change as you drive the car? How does changing the speed affect the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration? "],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_9_0"]}
