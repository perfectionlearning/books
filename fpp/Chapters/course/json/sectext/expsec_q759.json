We assume the field and velocity are perpendicular.  The charge must be moving for any force to occur. ","The animation shows the same positive charge moving in a magnetic field from two different views. In the side view, the field points away from you, and in the front view, it points from left to right. The charge moves at a constant speed, but it follows a curved path because the field applies a force on it. You see this directly in the side view, and as a slight shrinking in the particle’s size in the front view.","The angle between the magnetic field and the charge’s velocity vector is indicated by <i><math xmlns:xsl=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\"><mi>θ</mi></math></i>. The angle is hard to see in the diagram on the left, which is why we provide two views. ","The two diagrams show the direction of the force on a moving charge from two perspectives. ","The force points to the right in the side view shown in the diagram.  The magnetic field points away from you in this view: you see the rear of the field vector, its tail feathers, as represented with the <b>× </b>symbol.  (If it were pointing directly toward you, you would see its tip, just a point.)","On the right side of the diagram, we change perspective on the same situation, so the magnetic field goes from left to right.  In this view, the magnetic force of the field on the moving charge is directly at you, as indicated by your view of the tip of an arrow. Both diagrams show the same conclusion:  the magnetic force is perpendicular to both the velocity vector <b>and</b> to the field. "],"objNames":["wb_b_field_charged_particle_concepts"]}
