Mount Rainier stands about 14,000 feet high and its formation started “only” about 500,000 years ago, due to volcanic eruptions.  It is one of several peaks (Mount Baker, Mount Adams and so on) in the Pacific Northwest formed by this process. ","The speed with which the surface can rapidly be altered was illustrated by Mt. Saint Helens, which “blew its lid” over several days in 1980, and lost about 1,300 feet of its height in the process. The photograph you see illustrates Mt. Saint Helens, post eruption. ","In contrast, their neighbors in the Cascades Range started forming 12 million years ago.  Ranges such as the Cascades, the Rockies, the Himalayas cover more surface area than just the volcanic peaks.  "],"objNames":["wb_mt_st_helens"]}
