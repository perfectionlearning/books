Here we consider refracting telescopes.","When most people think of telescopes, they think of magnification.  But an equally important function of telescopes is to increase the light that reaches the eye.  The amount of light that a lens can gather is proportional to the square of its diameter, which may be hundreds of times larger than that of the pupil of your eye. ","The eyepiece in a refracting telescope is used to magnify the real image produced by the objective lens, and make it comfortable to view. By placing the image far away, the eyepiece allows the eye to relax. ","The two lenses in a telescope are converging lenses. The image formed by the objective lens is located at its focal point, because typically the object is very far away, and so the incoming light rays are essentially parallel. The eyepiece magnifies this image. The system is designed so the final image is at infinity since the eye is most relaxed when viewing faraway objects. ","The objective lens in a refracting telescope produces an image that is inverted, smaller than the object, and real. The eyepiece uses that image as its object. The final image you see when looking through a telescope is the virtual image produced by the eyepiece. "],"objNames":["wb_refract_telescope_concepts1","wb_refract_telescope_concepts2"]}
