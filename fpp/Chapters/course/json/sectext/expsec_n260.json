The wave front is the leading edge of the wave − the farthest points it has reached. ","When sound comes from a source − such as a bullhorn− it creates spherical waves. The sound spreads out in three dimensions.  (If it reaches a surface, it will bounce off − reflect from − that surface.)","A sphere provides the model for the spread of a sound wave (and for other waves, such as light).  Each moment, as the sound spreads out, its wave front can be modeled as the surface of a sphere.  The radius increases at the speed of the wave.","Since three dimensions can be hard to show on a two-dimensional display, the wave front is often represented in two dimensions, as we do in both diagrams."],"objNames":["wb_disturbance_and_wave_front","wb_spherical_concept"]}
