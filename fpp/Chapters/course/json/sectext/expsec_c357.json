In this case, the slope tells us how rapidly the aquarium is filling or emptying.","The graph of the water flow shows that the aquarium fills rapidly at first.  Why? The slope of the graph is steep and positive. It equals 4 gallons per second between 0 and 5 seconds. ","The graph shows that the flow of water into the tank slows at 5 seconds. As you can see, the graph is less steep starting at that time. From 5 to 10 seconds, the water entered the tank at 0.5 gallons per second.","What happens to the graph when the aquarium springs a leak?  The water in the tank has a negative rate and the line has a negative slope.  The line going down from left to right starting at 10 seconds means that the slope is negative.  The rate is negative 0.5 gallons per second."],"objNames":["wb_math_rate_aquarium3"]}
