There is a 50% chance that it is alive, but we do not normally describe living beings as “half-alive.”  They are either alive, or they’re not.   But there is no other way to accurately describe it.","Tying the cat back to quantum physics, Schrödinger’s thought experiment is parallel to observing a particle.  Its future location can only be described as a probability, as different as that is for us, given our typical manner of describing reality.  We can give a probability for where it will be, and it is more likely to be in certain locations than others, but it still remains a probability. ","The second part of Schrödinger’s thought experiment goes to what happens when a cat, or a particle, is in fact observed.  Once the chamber is opened, the cat is alive or dead, and a probability becomes one of two outcomes, in the case of a cat. Similarly, although there are limitations to how much precision we can observe with matter, we can in fact observe a particle, such as an electron, at a specific location, changing a probability into a specific outcome.
