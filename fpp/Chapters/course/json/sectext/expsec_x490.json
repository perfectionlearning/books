There is a 50% chance that it is alive, but we do not normally describe living beings as \u201chalf-alive.\u201d  They are either alive, or they\u2019re not.   But there is no other way to accurately describe it.","Tying the cat back to quantum physics, Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s thought experiment is parallel to observing a particle.  Its future location can only be described as a probability, as different as that is for us, given our typical manner of describing reality.  We can give a probability for where it will be, and it is more likely to be in certain locations than others, but it still remains a probability. ","The second part of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s thought experiment goes to what happens when a cat, or a particle, is in fact observed.  Once the chamber is opened, the cat is alive or dead, and a probability becomes one of two outcomes, in the case of a cat. Similarly, although there are limitations to how much precision we can observe with matter, we can in fact observe a particle, such as an electron, at a specific location, changing a probability into a specific outcome.
