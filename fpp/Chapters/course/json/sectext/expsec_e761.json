","Mass can be defined as the amount of matter.  But for our purposes, we want to define mass as it relates to force.  We say mass measures an object’s resistance to acceleration.  The unit for mass is the kilogram. ","The greater the mass, the more resistance to acceleration an object has.  For instance, it takes more force to accelerate the bus we show than it does to accelerate a bicycle by the same amount. "],"objNames":["wb_mass_definition_physics"]}
