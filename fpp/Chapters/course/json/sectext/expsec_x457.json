For instance, some deep-space spacecraft might have solar sails, and use light pressure for propulsion power. ","If light is thought of as consisting of a stream of particles, then light pressure can be explained by momentum transfer that takes place during the collisions of particles with the surface of an object.  When a photon is absorbed by a surface, momentum is transferred as in an inelastic collision.  ","Considering the collision as a momentum transfer yields two equations.  First, the magnitude of the photon’s momentum equals the photon energy divided by the speed of light. ","We can also write the related equation, that the energy of the photon equals the product of the photon’s momentum and the speed of light."],"objNames":["wb_radiation_pressure","wb_radiation_presssure_equations"]}
