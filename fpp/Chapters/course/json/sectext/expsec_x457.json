For instance, deep-space spacecraft can have solar sails, and use light pressure for propulsion power. ","If light is thought of as consisting of a stream of particles, then light pressure can be explained by momentum transfer that takes place during the collisions of particles with the surface of an object.  When a photon is absorbed by a surface, momentum is transferred as in an inelastic collision.  ","Early scientists such as Kepler had theorized that there was radiation pressure based on the shape of comets. But it wasn\u2019t until about 1900 that more sophisticated equipment allowed a scientist to prove its existence experimentally. ","Considering the collision as a momentum transfer yields two equations.  First, the magnitude of the photon\u2019s momentum equals the photon energy divided by the speed of light. ","We can also write the related equation, that the energy of the photon equals the product of the photon\u2019s momentum and the speed of light."],"objNames":["wb_radiation_pressure","wb_radiation_presssure_equations"]}
