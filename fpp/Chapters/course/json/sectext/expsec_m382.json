The red dot in the Slinky, representing a single particle, oscillates left and right.  The particles vibrate parallel to the direction of the wave.  A sound wave is another example of a longitudinal wave.  As the wave moves from left to right, the air particles vibrate back and forth in the same direction.  ","We stress − the air particles are oscillating, but they return to their original position.  It is the location of the disturbance that changes.  This property is common to both transverse and longitudinal waves.  ","The difference between the two types of waves is that particles vibrate parallel to the direction of the wave with longitudinal waves, and perpendicularly to the wave direction with transverse waves.
