So as with other units, you need to learn to convert between them.","You see thermometers representing three temperature scales. In the United States, the Fahrenheit scale is commonly used, but the Celsius and Kelvin scales are used more in the sciences. As the thermometers show, temperature values are different on each scale. For example, a comfortable indoor room temperature is 68° on the Fahrenheit scale, which equals 20° Celsius or 293.15 kelvins. ","The temperature at which water freezes is 0° on the Celsius scale. The temperatures that measure this point on other scales are also shown.","Absolute zero is the lowest temperature. Absolute zero is 0 K on the Kelvin scale. The Kelvin scale does not use the degree symbol.","There are 100 degrees between the freezing and boiling points of water on the Celsius scale, and 100 kelvins between freezing and boiling on the Kelvin scale. This means the <b>units</b> of these two scales are equal. ","It is 180 degrees between water freezing and boiling on the Fahrenheit scale.  This means a Fahrenheit degree is smaller than a Celsius degree or a kelvin (it is five-ninths the size)."],"objNames":["wb_temperature_scales_concepts"]}
