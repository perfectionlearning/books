    "The relationship between refractive indices determines in what direction light refracts. We explain this using both an example of where it moves slower in the second material, and an example where it moves faster.  Although we explain this using a light wave, the principle of the direction of refraction applies to other kinds of waves, such as seismic or water waves.",
    "In the upper illustration, the light moves to a material in which it slows down. This means it is moving from a material with a smaller index of refraction, <i>n</i><sub class=\"\">1</sub>, into one with a greater index of refraction, <i>n</i><sub class=\"\">2</sub>. When light slows, as it does here, it bends toward the normal. ",
    "When light enters a material where it travels faster, it bends away from the normal. In this case, <i>n</i><sub class=\"\">1</sub> is greater than <i>n</i><sub class=\"\">2</sub>.  We show this in the second illustration.  We measure both angles from the normal. You can see how the refracted angle is greater than the incident angle.  "
