In the photo, a laser shines a beam of light at a container of water. The light beam changes direction, or refracts, at the boundary between air and water.","Refraction is caused by a change in the speed of a wave as it crosses a boundary. Here, the light beam refracts because light travels more slowly in water than it does in air."],"objNames":["wb_refraction_concepts"]}
