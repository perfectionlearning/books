They measure the lens\u2019 ability to form a crisp image. ","As the diagrams show, the human eye can tense and relax to form lenses with different focal points.  It tenses to focus close objects, and relaxes to focus far objects. ","The lens has its limits in how much it can change form, which means the human eye cannot focus objects at all distances. The closest distance at which an object can be focused is called the near point. In the upper diagram, <i>N<\/i> labels the distance to this point. As people get older their near point becomes increasingly far away, as they can tense their lenses less than before.","The distance farthest from the eye at which an object can be clearly focused is called the far point. If your far point is not very far away, you are nearsighted and you need eyeglasses or contacts. "],"objNames":["wb_human_eye_concepts2","wb_human_eye_concepts3"]}
