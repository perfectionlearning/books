You may barely notice a small-amplitude wave passing by you, while a large-amplitude wave may knock you off your feet. In general, the power of a mechanical wave increases as the square of its amplitude.  For example, if the amplitude doubles, the wave carries four times as much energy per unit time.","Why does energy increase with amplitude? Think about creating a wave on a string.  If you shake it with little force and little displacement, you create a wave with little displacement − a small amplitude.  The small amount of force and displacement you applied means you did little work on the string, which means you did not increase its energy very much.","On the other hand, imagine you gave the string long, hard shakes.  The amplitude of the wave will be larger.  And in this case, you have done more work, and the work has produced a greater increase in the string’s energy."],"objNames":["wb_wave_amplitude_energy"]}
