When the [OBJ:expsec_f957:force on an object is at an angle] to the displacement, the work done on the object is equal to the force multiplied by the cosine of the angle between the force and displacement, and displacement.<br />2.  When the force on an object is in the opposite direction of the displacement, then the [OBJ:expsec_f958:work is negative].<br />3.  By creating a graph of displacement versus force, we can determine the amount of [OBJ:expsec_f960:work done when the amount of force changes]. The area under the curve is the amount of work done.","  <b>STEM Skills:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1. Review [OBJ:expsec_d477:trigonometric functions].<br />2. Review [OBJ:expsec_e754:force].<br />3.
