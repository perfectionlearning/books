In this section, we discuss how to determine when components are in series and when they are in parallel. ","If there is no junction between two components, they are in series. The two resistors to the far right are in series. All the current that flows through one resistor must flow through the other. ","The current splits between the <i>R<\/i><sub class=\"\">1<\/sub> resistor and the <i>R<\/i><sub class=\"\">2<\/sub><i>R<\/i><sub class=\"\">3<\/sub> series combination, and then reconnects after passing through the two branches. This means <i>R<\/i><sub class=\"\">1<\/sub> is in parallel with the <i>R<\/i><sub class=\"\">2<\/sub><i>R<\/i><sub class=\"\">3<\/sub> series. ","The potential difference across the battery, between points A and B, and between points C and D, is the same. The amount of current flowing through each branch can be different.
