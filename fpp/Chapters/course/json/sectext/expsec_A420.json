","The six leptons are similarly arranged in three generations \u2212 the electron and the electron neutrino in the first generation, the muon and the muon neutrino in the second, and the tau and the tau neutrino in the third. The electron, the muon, and the tau all have an electric charge and a mass, while the neutrinos are electrically neutral with very little mass.","Our everyday world is made up of just three of these building blocks: the up quark, the down quark, and the electron. This set of particles is sufficient to make protons and neutrons and to form atoms and molecules. The electron neutrino, observed in the decay of other particles, completes the set of four building blocks that form the first generation of matter particles."],"objNames":["wb_standard_model2"]}
