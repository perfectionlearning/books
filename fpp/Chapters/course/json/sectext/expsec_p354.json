As the diagram illustrates, current is the rate at which the electrons\u2019 charge passes through a section of the wire defined by the blue line.","The currents found in typical household appliances consist of moving electrons. But any flow of charge \u2212 positive or negative \u2212 is a current.  ","The letter <i>I<\/i> is used to represent current.  It represents the net flow of charge. The unit for current is the ampere. One ampere is the flow of one coulomb of charge in one second. The capital letter A represents the ampere. Whether electrons or protons are moving, current is a positive quantity. "],"objNames":["wb_electric_current_concepts1","wb_current_equation"]}
