The puck again is on a horizontal surface, with graph paper passing by it. ","A cycle means the object has returned to an initial position and condition. For instance, the object has gone from one trough to the next trough in the area we circle. ","We measure cycles from peak to adjacent peak, or trough to adjacent trough.  This allows us to measure the amount of time to complete a cycle.","When a cycle is completed, a system not only has returned to its initial position, but other properties, such as energy, velocity, acceleration, and temperature, are also the same as they were initially.
