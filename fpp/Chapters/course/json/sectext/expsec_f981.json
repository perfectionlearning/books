But it can move from one object to another.  ","For example, when the archer pulls the string back, he is transferring energy from his body to the bow.  ","When he releases the string, energy transfers from the bow to the arrow.   ","The place where the energy transfers may not always be obvious, but it always occurs.  Energy cannot appear or disappear.  Look carefully, for it may not always take the form of mechanical energy (kinetic and potential energy).","For example, in our bow and arrow example, energy was initially stored in the archer’s body as chemical energy, then was transferred to the bow as elastic <i>PE</i>, then to the arrow. When the arrow hits the ground, where did its mechanical energy go?  Since it is in the ground, it has no gravitational potential energy.  And since it is not moving, it has no kinetic energy. ","Most of the energy transferred to the ground. Some of the arrow’s kinetic energy heated up the ground, causing individual molecules to randomly move faster, and sound waves were also generated, carrying energy away.  It is more important to know that the total energy was conserved than to track every possible form that the energy could have gone to.
