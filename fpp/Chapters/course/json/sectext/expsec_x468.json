We start with the two extreme cases: <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_conductor_concepts'>insulators and conductors</a>.  In the next section, we discuss semiconductors. ","The lower-energy band is called the “valence band.” The term is used to describe an atom’s outermost electrons that typically participate in chemical reactions. ","The higher-energy band is the conduction band. Electrons in this band are farther from the nuclei of atoms and are freer to move in an electric current. When a potential difference is applied across a material, its electrons must increase their average energy and move into the conduction band for a current to flow.","In an insulator, the valence band is full of electrons, and the conduction band is essentially empty. The diagram of the insulator reflects the large energy gap between the valence and conduction bands. ","This region is called the “forbidden gap.” This gap is why an insulator is an insulator: It requires a relatively large amount of energy to get electrons into its conduction band.  ","We show the valence and conduction bands in a conductor. The bands overlap, and the overlapping portion is partially full of electrons. Materials with this band structure are conductors because they have a ready supply of mobile electrons."],"objNames":["wb_atom_energy_levels3","wb_atom_energy_levels4"]}
