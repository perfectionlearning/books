{"cards":[{"lines":[{"type":"title","text":"GPS versus cell towers for position information"}]}],"definitions":[],"secText":["In this section, we finish presenting information about GPS and cell towers. GPS receivers are useful to find your location and to get directions. Is it worth paying for a GPS device or using one that may come for free in your phone?  Are the inevitable newer-generation devices worth upgrading to?  ","One obvious inference (conclusion) from the promotional references to 24 satellites is that you can use them all.  You cannot. First, though 24 satellites do sound impressive, the satellites use line-of-sight signals.  In other words, if you could not theoretically see the satellite via a telescope, you cannot receive the signal.  This means that fewer than half the 24 satellites are available to you.  Second, the same line-of-sight principle applies to tall buildings, trees, and so on.  ","You can judge this for yourself by doing some experiments.  Some GPS receivers will tell you how many satellites they are receiving signals from.  You can also determine the accuracy of a system by reading its reported position when it is at a known location.  ","The cell phone tower positioning devices show applications such as noting the arrival at a restaurant as empirical evidence of their accuracy.  The devices seem to be mostly marketed via claims such as this, as opposed to precise claims about their accuracy.  The lack of specific evidence about the accuracy of the system, or usually minimal information about its implementation, is a warning sign about its capabilities."],"objNames":["wb_market_service2"]}
