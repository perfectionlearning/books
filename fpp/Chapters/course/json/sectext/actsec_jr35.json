{"cards":[{"lines":[{"type":"title","text":"Experiment with induction"}]}],"definitions":[],"secText":["In this activity, you begin your exploration of electromagnetic induction.  You study the results of motion in a magnetic field as well as the results of changes in electric currents. These phenomena underlie the generation of most electrical energy.","In the activity, you control the current in the upper circuit on the left. By setting the sliderâ€™s position, you determine the amount and direction of the current. You will see the magnetic field lines created by the current of this circuit. The more intense their color, the stronger the magnetic field.","When you launch the simulation, you will see that an oscilloscope is attached to the bottom circuit. It displays the potential difference across the light bulb.","Experiment by changing the current in the top circuit and observing what happens in the bottom circuit. By moving the slider back and forth, you can continuously change the current. Is there a current in the bottom circuit if the current in the top circuit is steady and unchanging? What if the current in the top circuit is changing? Does the rate at which the current in the top circuit changes have any effect on the potential difference you measure in the other circuit?"],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_32_0"]}
