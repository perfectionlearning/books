The [OBJ:expsec_A419:Standard Model] is composed of all the sub-atomic particles which make up the building blocks of matter: [OBJ:expsec_A420:quarks], [OBJ:expsec_A420:leptons], [OBJ:expsec_A420:fermions], and [OBJ:expsec_A421:bosons].<br />2. [OBJ:expsec_A423:Dark matter] is matter that does not emit light, and its existence is deduced from the properties of gravity. Its composition is not known. [OBJ:expsec_A423mi:Dark energy] has not been observed, but its existence is inferred from the expansion of the universe. Dark matter is repulsive.<br />3. [OBJ:expsec_A424:Black holes] are composed of matter so dense that the force of gravity within the black hole prevents light from escaping.<br />4. [OBJ:expsec_A425:Gravitational lensing] causes light to change direction because of a strong gravitational force.<br />5. The [OBJ:expsec_A426:Big Bang] theory is the model for the origin of the universe.","  <b>Vocabulary:</b>  [OBJ:expsec_A419:Standard Model], [OBJ:expsec_A422:Higgs boson], [OBJ:expsec_A423:dark matter], [OBJ:expsec_A423mi:dark energy], [OBJ:expsec_A424:black holes], [OBJ:expsec_A425:gravitational lensing], [OBJ:expsec_A426:Big Bang]","  <b>STEM Skills:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1.
