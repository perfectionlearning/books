It relates the differing path lengths of the waves to the wavelength and the angle they travel to a point on the screen. We assume that the screen is very far away relative to the slit spacing, so the rays may be treated as parallel.","As the diagram shows, the first pair of bright bands from the central band are numbered <i>m<\/i> = 1, the next ones farther out are <i>m<\/i> = 2, and so on."],"objNames":["wb_interference_wave_equation","wb_calculating_wavelength_concepts1"]}
