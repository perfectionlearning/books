We use them to show that there are differences in things like the work done along paths between the same two points \u2212 which is to say, engines can differ in their design, and these differences cause changes in their performance.","The graph reflects the fact that at any moment, the gas in the cylinder has a certain pressure and volume, which we can plot as a point. The engine changes pressure or volume during a process, as the system moves from one state to the next, so all the points connect to form curved or straight paths. ","We show two points, labeled \u201cInitial\u201d and \u201cFinal,\u201d and two different processes by which the gas\u2019s properties can change between these points. We will look at these two processes in detail next."],"objNames":["wb_PV_graphs_concepts1"]}
