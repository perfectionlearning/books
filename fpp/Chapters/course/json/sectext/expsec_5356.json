The parentheses tell us to apply the exponent to −3.","In the second problem, we are told that <span class=\"math\"><i>x</i> = −2</span>, so we substitute −<span class=\"math\">2 </span>for <span class=\"math\"><i>x</i></span>.","We evaluate the terms with exponents first. We cube −2 to get −8 and square −2 to get 4.","Multiplication and division come next.  We multiply −<span class=\"math\">3 </span>by −<span class=\"math\">8</span> to get 24.
