Then we multiply by <span class=\"math\">\u22121.<\/span>  The value of <span class=\"math\">\u22123<sup>2<\/sup><\/span> is <span class=\"math\">\u22129.<\/span>","Exponents are a shortcut to say to multiply a factor by itself.  The parentheses tell us to apply the exponent to \u22123.","In the second problem, we are told that <span class=\"math\"><i>x<\/i> = \u22122<\/span>, so we substitute \u2212<span class=\"math\">2 <\/span>for <span class=\"math\"><i>x<\/i><\/span>.","We evaluate the terms with exponents first. We cube \u22122 to get \u22128 and square \u22122 to get 4.","Multiplication and division come next.  We multiply \u2212<span class=\"math\">3 <\/span>by \u2212<span class=\"math\">8<\/span> to get 24. ","We add and subtract from left to right.
