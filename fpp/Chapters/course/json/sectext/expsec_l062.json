The piston is locked in place. As heat flows from the hot reservoir into the engine, the gas’s thermal energy increases. This means its temperature increases, as the temperature gauge shows. ","Since the volume cannot increase, the gas pressure also increases. The first law of thermodynamics applies: Heat increases the thermal energy of a system when no work is done.","The second process is summarized in the second diagram. The piston is unlocked, and the gas does work on the piston, causing it to rise. Some heat also exits the engine into the cold reservoir. During this process, the pressure and temperature decrease. Again, the first law of thermodynamics applies, as thermal energy is used to push the piston up, or, transfers out as waste heat."],"objNames":["wb_engine_processes_concepts1","wb_engine_processes_concepts2"]}
