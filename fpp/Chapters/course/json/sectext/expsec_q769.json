    "A simple electric motor consists of magnets, wires and an electric current.    ",
    "As the diagram shows, two permanent “horseshoe” magnets occupy the extremes of the motor. These magnets form the circular exterior of the motor. With their north poles and their south poles held together, the two magnets combine to create a strong horizontal magnetic field. ",
    "The rotor is made up of a rotating bar wrapped with a coil of <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_conductor_concepts'>conducting wire</a>. A <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_electric_current_concepts1'>current</a> flows through the rotor coil.  This current-carrying coil acts as an electromagnet, acting as a magnet because the current creates a magnetic field.",
    "The magnetic field of the permanent magnets creates a magnetic field that causes the rotor to rotate counterclockwise as shown.",
    "Unfortunately, this design alone does not make for an effective motor. The coil will move to an equilibrium point and then a bit beyond due to inertia and it will soon rest at equilibrium. What is necessary is a system that continues to rotate, which is provided with a component that we discuss in the next section."
