","In the upper illustration, you see light traveling from one material into another, and then into a third. Snell\u2019s law would be applied twice in this situation, once at each boundary. ","A common example of multiple refraction is light passing through a window. Light refracts twice when it passes through a window at an angle. We show this in the lower illustration.  The first refraction occurs when light passes from the air to the glass.  It refracts toward the normal as it moves more slowly.","The light refracts again as it passes from the glass back into the air.  It refracts away from the normal in the faster medium. The final ray has some displacement from the original ray but is parallel. ","The displacement effect is small, so we usually do not notice it. However, it becomes quite noticeable if a flat pane of glass is placed over half of an object such as a newspaper page."],"objNames":["wb_snell_multiple_concepts","wb_refraction_applied_concepts3"]}
