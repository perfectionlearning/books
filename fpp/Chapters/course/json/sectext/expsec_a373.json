We want to write this number using scientific notation. We start by writing the number with a leading value greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10. That is 1.05 in this case. ","To make 1.05 equal to 105,000 we have to multiply it by 100,000. The result of 1.05 times 100,000 is 105,000. ","We write 100,000 using exponential notation. There are 5 zeros, which means 5 factors of 10, which is 10<sup class=\"\">5<\/sup>. ","As a shortcut, you can count how many places the decimal point moved. In this case, it moved 5 places to the right, as we show. This means the power of 10 is 10<sup class=\"\">5<\/sup>. The exponent is positive when the decimal is moved to the right."],"objNames":["wb_math_largeNumberSN"]}
