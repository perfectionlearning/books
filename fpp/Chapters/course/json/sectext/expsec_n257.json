Or even with dolphins?  They do use frequencies that we cannot hear.    ","The chart displays the audible range of sound frequencies for humans and some animals. Although dogs are famed for hearing a wide range of frequencies, bats and dolphins actually have far wider hearing ranges.","Some musical instruments are designed to play notes below the lowest limit of human hearing (20 Hz). For example, the organ in the Sydney, Australia Town Hall can play a low, low C that vibrates at only 8 Hz, a rumbling that can only be felt by the audience members. Low frequency sounds are also used in movies and some arcade games to increase tension and suspense."],"objNames":["wb_table_human_perception_concepts","wb_human_perception_concepts"]}
