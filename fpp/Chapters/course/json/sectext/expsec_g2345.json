Both have the same average value (trust us). But as the graphs show, there is more variation in the measurements from sample 2 − its values deviate further from the average value. The concept of standard deviation provides a tool for analyzing this. ","The standard deviation measures how spread out the values are from the mean. The larger the standard deviation, the more the data values vary from the mean. The charts show that the temperature varies more in sample 2 than in sample 1.","You can use the formula shown to calculate the standard deviation. First, calculate the mean. Then, subtract the mean from each data value, and square the result. Add all these numbers. Subtract 1 from the count, divide the sum by this number, and take the square root."],"objNames":["wb_standardDeviation","wb_standard_DeviationFormula"]}
