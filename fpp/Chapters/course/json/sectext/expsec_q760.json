We show in the diagram how to apply the right-hand rule.  ","The fingers start out pointing in the same direction as the velocity vector, and then they curl toward the magnetic field through the smaller of the two angles between the vectors. To emphasize: To apply the right-hand rule, you must sweep the fingers on your right hand <b>from<\/b> the velocity direction <b>to<\/b> the magnetic field direction. ","The thumb then points in the direction of the force on a moving positive charge. If the charge is negative, the force acts the opposite direction as it would on a positive charge. In other words, the same rule is applied, but the force is directed 180\u00b0 from the force on a positive charge moving in the same direction as the negative charge."],"objNames":["wb_right_hand_rule_concepts"]}
