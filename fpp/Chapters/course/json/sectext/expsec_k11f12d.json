Since the points do not rise and fall (or fall and rise), it also does not appear to be quadratic. With just a few data points, it may take some trials to find the best model. To model this set of data, the best choice is an exponential regression. ","Using a spreadsheet, we enter the data to create a scatter plot, and ask for an exponential trendline.  The spreadsheet returns the equation <i>y<\/i> = 219e<sup class=\"\">0.679<\/sup><sup class=\"\">x<\/sup><sup class=\"\"><\/sup>with an <i>r<\/i><sup class=\"\">2<\/sup> of 0.9899. (e is an irrational constant equal to about 2.718.) The equation is a good fit, and we believe that the data looks like it could be modeled with an exponential equation.
