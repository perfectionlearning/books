","We show how to use a ray diagram to determine the position and other properties of an image. As you can see, we choose two rays that start at the same point on the object but head off in different directions, which means they arrive at different locations on the mirror. We use the law of reflection to determine the reflection angle for each ray. ","The rays we draw as dashed lines are called virtual rays. They show the path of reflected rays as if they started behind the mirror.  We use the intersection of the virtual rays to locate a point on the image.
