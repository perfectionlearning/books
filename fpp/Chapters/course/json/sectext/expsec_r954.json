","The interference you see in the upper diagram is caused by the overlap of two expanding waves that each start at a single point.  ","As the two waves <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_superposition_concepts1'>collide<\/a>, they interfere and produce the pattern you see.  The striped bands are where waves reinforce one another to produce waves with greater amplitude.  We start with water waves to demonstrate interference, but all forms of waves can interfere.  This means both transverse waves, such as water and light, and longitudinal waves, such as sound.","As we mentioned, light waves can interfere. The lower photograph illustrates a \u201cshowy\u201d example of this. The shimmering color of a peacock\u2019s feathers is in part due to interference effects. Structures in the feathers cause light interference, in a particular example known as <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_thin_film_2'>thin-film interference<\/a>.
