[OBJ:expsec_i965:Torque] causes or opposes rotation. It is measured in newton meters.<br />2. When the [OBJ:expsec_i967:force is not perpendicular to the torque], torque is calculated by multiplying the position vector by the force, by the sine of the angle between the position vector and the force.<br />3. [OBJ:expsec_i968:Net torque] is the sum of all torques acting on an object.","  <b>Vocabulary:</b>  [OBJ:expsec_i965:torque], [OBJ:expsec_i968:net torque]","  <b>STEM Skills:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1.
