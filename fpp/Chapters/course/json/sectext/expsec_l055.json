Before Joule’s studies, heat and work were believed to be unrelated.","The scientist, James Joule, used an experiment similar to the one shown here to determine the relationship between work, thermal energy, and heat.","In the experiment, the falling weight causes the paddles to rotate. The mechanical potential energy of the weight is used to do work on the system. The spinning paddles increase the water’s thermal energy, which is reflected in its increased temperature. Joule discovered that the increase in the water’s temperature was proportional to the work done on the system.","Joule could also calculate how much heat would be required to increase the temperature of the water the same amount as the work done by the paddles did. This enabled him to mathematically define the relationship between the work done on the system and heat. "],"objNames":["wb_Joule_concepts"]}
