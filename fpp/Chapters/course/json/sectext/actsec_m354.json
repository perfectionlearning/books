{"cards":[{"lines":[{"type":"title","text":"Simple harmonic motion"}]}],"definitions":[],"secText":["This chapter will give you a new take on the saying, \u201cWhat goes around comes around.\u201d  Motion that repeats itself at regular intervals is called \u201cperiodic motion.\u201d A mechanical metronome or a pendulum provides an excellent example of periodic motion. Simple harmonic motion (SHM) describes a specific type of periodic motion. ","To start your study of SHM, try the activity. An air hockey puck is attached to a spring, and glides without friction or air resistance over an air hockey table, which you view from overhead. When the puck is pushed and released, it moves in simple harmonic motion.","A pen is attached to the puck, and paper underneath it scrolls to the left over time. This produces a graph of the displacement over time. ","You can change the amplitude and period of the puck\u2019s motion. The amplitude is the maximum displacement of the puck. The period is the time it takes the puck to complete one full cycle of motion.","As you play with the controls, make a few observations. For instance, does changing the amplitude change the period, or are these quantities independent? "],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_15_0"]}
