","Equipment used in health care and biochemistry uses parts of the electromagnetic spectrum such as X-rays. The waves can easily penetrate some parts of the human body but are mostly stopped by bones, creating images like that of the skull you see.  Also, their small wavelength, about the size of atoms, makes these waves useful in diffraction studies of complex protein molecules.","The illustration also shows images made by X-rays emitted from the surface of the Sun.
