As altitude increases, pressure decreases. This is why jetliners must have pressurized cabins at cruising altitudes \u2212 the air pressure at 10,000 meters is about a quarter of what it is at sea level. ","The density of the air decreases with altitude as well. There are fewer molecules per cubic meter at higher altitudes than at lower ones. This is one reason that airplanes cruise at higher altitudes \u2212 there are fewer molecules to collide with, so there is less air resistance. ","It also gets colder at higher altitudes. This is a reason that tall mountains, like the 8,000-meter peaks of the Himalayas, are so difficult to climb. On top of a peak like Everest, it is cold and there is little air to breathe.
