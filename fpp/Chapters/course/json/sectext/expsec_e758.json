We quote Newton in our definition above, since Newton packed a lot of physics in a sentence.  ","To update Sir Newton\u2019s definition, we say that objects move at a constant velocity unless acted upon by a net force.  To put it another way: The object\u2019s acceleration is zero unless it is acted upon by a net force. The first law is sometimes called the law of inertia.","Note that we say \u201cconstant velocity.\u201d  An object will keep moving at, say, 20 meters per second in the same direction, unless a net force acts on it to change this velocity. ","An object will also stay at rest \u2212 unmoving \u2212 unless it is acted upon by a net force.  An object at rest keeps a constant velocity also, a velocity of zero.
