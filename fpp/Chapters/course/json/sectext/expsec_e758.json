We quote Newton in our definition above, since Newton packed a lot of physics in a sentence.  ","To update Sir Newton’s definition, we say that objects move at a constant velocity unless acted upon by a net force.  To put it another way: The object’s acceleration is zero unless it is acted upon by a net force. The first law is sometimes called the law of inertia.","Note that we say “constant velocity.”  An object will keep moving at, say, 20 meters per second in the same direction, unless a net force acts on it to change this velocity. ","An object will also stay at rest − unmoving − unless it is acted upon by a net force.  An object at rest keeps a constant velocity also, a velocity of zero.
