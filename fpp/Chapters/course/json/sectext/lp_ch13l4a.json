A [OBJ:expsec_m377:wave] is a disturbance that carries energy through matter or space. Examples of mechanical waves are water and seismic waves. Examples of electromagnetic waves are light and radio signals.<br />2. A [OBJ:expsec_m379:wave pulse] is a wave with a single disturbance. A [OBJ:expsec_m379:periodic wave] is a continuing wave with a consistent pattern.<br />3. [OBJ:expsec_m379555:Wave amplitude] is the maximum distance from the midpoint of the wave. [OBJ:expsec_m379555:Wave period] is the time it takes the wave to complete one cycle. [OBJ:expsec_m379555:Wave frequency] is the number of wave cycles per second.<br />4. [OBJ:expsec_m386:Wavelength] is a property that applies to waves and not to simple harmonic motion. Wavelength is the distance between adjacent peaks.<br />5. The [OBJ:expsec_m385:energy of a wave] increases as its amplitude increases.","  <b>Vocabulary:</b>  [OBJ:expsec_m377:wave], [OBJ:expsec_m377:medium], [OBJ:expsec_m377:mechanical wave], [OBJ:expsec_m379:wave pulse], [OBJ:expsec_m379:periodic wave], [OBJ:expsec_m386:wavelength]","  <b>STEM Skills:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1.
