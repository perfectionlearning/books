Instead, this energy goes to increasing the mass of the particles. Einstein stated the equivalence of mass and energy. The mass of the assembled deuterium nucleus is 2.01355 atomic mass units, a unit we will explain shortly. The sum of the masses of the separated particles is 2.01594 atomic mass units. Their mass increases by 0.00239 atomic mass units. ","An atomic mass unit is based on carbon-12 atoms and equals about 1.66\u00d710<sup class=\"\">\u221227<\/sup> kilograms.
