It produces an interference pattern that can be used to analyze light."}],"secText":["Diffraction gratings can be scientific equipment, but CDs and DVDs also can provide the same effect.","A material with many, many small parallel slits or grooves is called a diffraction grating. The slits are quite close together, separated by a distance that\u2019s nearly the same as the wavelength of light. The interference pattern from a diffraction grating is akin to that produced by a two-slit configuration. However, the bright bands are much more distinct in a diffraction grating pattern.
