For instance, we consider 30 metal bars, some made of aluminum and some made of steel.   Each bar is part of a group, either aluminum or steel. ","To construct a two-way table, we add another set of categories of data. In our example, it is whether the bar cracked under stress, or remained uncracked when placed under stress.","We fill in the table with how many bars fit into these categories.  For instance, in our experiment with 30 bars, we count 2 that are aluminum and cracked.  There are 4 that are aluminum and uncracked. The cells with “2” and “4” are called joint frequencies. They are the “joint” (joining) of aluminum and cracked, or aluminum and uncracked.","We have filled in the other categories of information.  For instance, 19 bars are steel and uncracked. That is another joint frequency.","The total of a row or column is called a marginal frequency.  For instance, “6 bars are aluminum” is a marginal frequency. “23 bars are uncracked” is another marginal frequency."],"objNames":["wb_two_way_table1"]}
