","Mirrors and other smooth surfaces exhibit specular reflection, as does the ornament on the right side of the photograph. The right-hand ornament is extremely smooth and produces a specular reflection. Specular reflection means that the rays that are parallel and close together when they strike the ornament will all be moving in a new direction after they reflect, but they will still be parallel.  The law of reflection, a focus of this chapter, applies to surfaces that exhibit specular reflection.","If the reflecting surface is rough, diffuse reflection results. The ornament in the left side of the photograph provides an example of diffuse reflection. With a rough surface, neighboring incident rays will reflect in a variety of directions. Rays that are parallel and close together when they strike the surface will not be parallel after they reflect. ","Diffuse reflection is sometimes desirable. For instance, matte (low gloss) wall paint is designed to achieve diffuse reflection for surfaces where a shiny appearance is not desired."],"objNames":["wb_specular_diffusion"]}
