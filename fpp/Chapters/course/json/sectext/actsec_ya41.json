In this case, the action takes place on the Moon, so the freefall acceleration is not the same as on Earth. Your challenge is to match the graph by setting the soccer ball\u2019s initial velocity and the freefall acceleration.","The graph goes through exact grid points at the beginning, as the ball reaches its maximum height, and as the ball returns to the ground and stops. These grid point values should help you to calculate both the initial velocity and the acceleration. (You could look up the Moon\u2019s freefall acceleration, but there are different reported values, so you may not find the one we used. Better to do the analysis.) Since there are two unknown values, you will need to use two equations.","Enter the initial velocity to the nearest 0.1 m\/s and the acceleration to the nearest 0.1 m\/s<sup class=\"\">2<\/sup> and press GO.
