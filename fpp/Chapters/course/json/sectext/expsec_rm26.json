Since this is a physics textbook, we focus on the test standards used to mimic a collision. We provide some analysis of the standard used to test helmets, but we encourage you to do more research, analysis, and experimentation.  ","In explaining how helmets are tested, NOCSAE wrote:  <br \/><i>Two 60-inch drops onto the side are also conducted. An equivalent to the 60-inch drop test would occur if a player running at 17.9 feet per second (12.2 mph) ran into a flat surface that stopped his head in less than one inch.<\/i>","How might you analyze their information? <a class='pjumpToTopic' href='javascript:void(0)' data-chap='1' data-topic='4' data-subtopic='1' data-subsection='0'>Using motion equations<\/a>, you could check whether an object dropped from 60 inches is in fact moving at 17.9 feet per second upon impact.  Some unit conversion analysis also lets you check that 17.9 feet per second equals 12.2 miles per hour.  ","NOCSAE also wrote:<u><\/u><u><br \/><\/u><i>Most players run faster than this, i.e., the average speed of a player running 40 yards in 4.8 seconds is 25 feet per second, but very rarely would the head be stopped in such a short distance on the football field.<\/i>","A high school football game, or one broadcast on television, would allow you to test these statements.  How fast are football players going right before impact? How often are they going at their top speeds versus being \u201ccaught up in traffic\u201d before they are brought down?  Videotaping a game could help you answer such questions. Similar methods might also let you begin to measure how fast heads are stopped, and over what distance.  "],"objNames":["wb_concussions4"]}
