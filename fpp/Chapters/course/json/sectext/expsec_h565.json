","Although the distance is large between Earth and the Moon, the two bodies attract each other with a large force of about 1.98×10<sup class=\"\">20</sup> newtons. The large masses of planets, stars, and many moons make for strong attractive forces. ","In contrast, even though this car and truck are only 15 meters apart, they attract each other with a force of 0.00000072 newtons or 7.2×10<sup class=\"\">−7</sup> newtons. When you press a button on a telephone, you press with a force of about one newton, which is about 1.4 million times greater than the force between the two vehicles."],"objNames":["wb_gravity_examples1","wb_gravity_examples2"]}
