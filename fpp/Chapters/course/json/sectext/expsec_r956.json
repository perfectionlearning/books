Lasers are a typical source of monochromatic, coherent light.  Coherent wave sources will produce interference patterns, like the pattern we showed earlier. ","Incoherent wave sources have changing phase differences. Typical light bulbs are a classic example of a source of incoherent light.  The phase difference between light bulbs varies randomly.  Waves from the bulbs will produce interference, but their random nature of phase differences means no interference pattern results."],"objNames":["wb_interference_intro2","wb_interference_intro3"]}
