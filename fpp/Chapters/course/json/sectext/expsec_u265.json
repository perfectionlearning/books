The wave property of total internal reflection is used to keep the light within the cable.","In the diagram, no light is passing from the water into the air. All the light is reflected at the boundary between the media. This is called total internal reflection.","For total internal reflection to occur, the light must start in a material with a greater index of refraction than the surrounding material. For example, it can occur when light attempts to move from water to air, or from glass to air. In the animation, where the angle of incidence starts out small, you will initially see both refraction and reflection occur. Once the angle of incidence becomes large enough, just at the point where the refracted angle is a right angle, the light ceases to pass into the air, and all the light is reflected. Total internal reflection occurs and the light stays within the initial medium. "],"objNames":["wb_total_internal_concepts"]}
