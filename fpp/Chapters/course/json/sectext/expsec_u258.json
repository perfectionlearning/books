    "Snell’s law allows the angle of refraction to be calculated. We show Snell’s law below as both a pair of products and a pair of ratios. The angles are measured from the normal. Snell’s Law tells us that if the light ray enters a slower medium, one with a <b>greater</b> index of refraction, the refracted angle will be smaller than the incident angle. In other words, if light enters a slower medium, it bends toward the normal. If it enters a faster medium, it bends away from the normal.",
