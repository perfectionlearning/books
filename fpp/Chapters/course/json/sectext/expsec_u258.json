We show Snell\u2019s law below as both a pair of products and a pair of ratios. The angles are measured from the normal. Snell\u2019s Law tells us that if the light ray enters a slower medium, one with a <b>greater<\/b> index of refraction, the refracted angle will be smaller than the incident angle. In other words, if light enters a slower medium, it bends toward the normal. If it enters a faster medium, it bends away from the normal.","Note how the subscripts \u201cchange places\u201d on the two sides of the second equation, with incident in the numerator on the left, and in the denominator on the right.
