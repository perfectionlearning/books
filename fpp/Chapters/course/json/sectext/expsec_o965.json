A ground is a conductor large enough that it can remove the excess charge from an object without becoming noticeably charged itself. Grounds get their name because the surface of Earth (the ground) acts as a ground. ","A lightning bolt contains a huge amount of charge, but when it hits the ground (as in the photograph), Earth absorbs the electrons. The lightning rod we showed earlier ends in the ground. In summary, a ground will absorb or supply charged particles, causing a charged object to become neutral. "],"objNames":["wb_ground_concepts"]}
