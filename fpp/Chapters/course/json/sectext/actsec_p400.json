The plates will have a potential difference of 175 volts across them when you press GO to close a switch.","Your mission is to set the distance (in millimeters) between the plates so that the charge on one plate is 2.00 nC. The plates are squares, each exactly 10 cm on a side, so the surface area of each plate is 0.0100 m<sup class=\"\">2</sup>. Be careful with these varied units!","Once you have made your calculations and set the distance, press the GO button. It closes a switch and the charge will flow. (The charge flows far more slowly than it would in reality, to add a little suspense.)"],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_28_5"]}
