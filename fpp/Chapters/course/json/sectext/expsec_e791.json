","We want to add these two vectors. If necessary, we first translate (slide) one so that the two tails are at the same point. In translation, the length and angle of the vectors stay the same.   ","We then draw a parallelogram. Each side of the parallelogram is parallel and equal in length to one of the vectors. ","We draw a diagonal from the starting point of the vectors to the opposite vertex. The diagonal is the sum of the vectors.<span class=\"math\"></span>"],"objNames":["wb_parallelogram_add_concept"]}
