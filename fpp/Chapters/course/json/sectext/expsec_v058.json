We show two types of hydrogen in the upper diagram.  The fact that both have a single proton in the nucleus means both are hydrogen.","Isotopes have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. The two atoms we show are isotopes of hydrogen:  deuterium and tritium. Common hydrogen − which we do not show − has no neutrons, only a lone proton. Deuterium has one proton and one neutron. The third form of hydrogen, tritium, has one proton and two neutrons in its nucleus. ","Isotopes are named by counting the number of particles (nucleons) in their nucleus.  For example, carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, while carbon-13 has 6 protons and 7 neutrons."],"objNames":["wb_isotopes"]}
