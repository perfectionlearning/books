","The accelerator has a circumference of 26,659\u00a0meters and houses 9,300 magnets inside, and these are not ordinary magnets. First they are precooled to \u2212193.2\u00b0C (80 K) using 10,080 tons of liquid nitrogen, and then they are filled with nearly 120 tons of liquid helium to bring them down to <span class=\"Symbols\">\u2212<\/span>271.3\u00b0C (1.9 K).","At full power, trillions of protons race around the accelerator ring 11,245 times a second, travelling at 99.9999991% the speed of light. All together, some 600 million collisions take place every second.","To avoid colliding with gas molecules inside the accelerator, the beams of particles travel in an ultra-high vacuum \u2212 a cavity as empty as interplanetary space.
