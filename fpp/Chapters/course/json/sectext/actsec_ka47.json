{"cards":[{"lines":[{"type":"title","text":"Force, mass, and acceleration"}]}],"definitions":[],"secText":["Objects can speed up, slow down, and change direction while they move. In short, they accelerate. A famous scientist, Sir Isaac Newton, wondered how and why acceleration occurs. Theories about acceleration existed, but Newton did not find them very convincing. His skepticism led him to some of the most important discoveries in physics.","You can conduct your own experiments concerning force, mass, and acceleration, and draw your own conclusions. In the simulation, you perform some of the basic tasks required of a helicopter pilot. To do so, you control the net force on the helicopter. You use the up and down arrow keys to set the net force. ","To start, apply a positive net force to cause the helicopter to rise off the ground. Next, attempt to have the helicopter reach a constant vertical velocity. For an optional challenge, have it hover at a constant height of 15 meters, and finally, attempt to land (not crash) the helicopter."],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_05_0"]}
