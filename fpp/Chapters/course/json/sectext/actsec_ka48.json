What lift force should the helicopter blades supply to accomplish this?","To solve this problem, you will need to first determine the appropriate acceleration using a motion equation, then calculate the net force required. Hint: Make sure you consider both of the forces acting on the helicopter! Enter the lift force to the nearest 100 N."],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_05_31"]}
