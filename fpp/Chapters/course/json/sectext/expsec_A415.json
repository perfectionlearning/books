","Accelerators increase the energy of particles to very high values.  The particles can be moving at more than 99.99% of the speed of light.  Scientists in the 1920s could not find particles with very much energy. To find such high-energy conditions, the best they could do was to climb mountaintops and examine cosmic rays.  Simply put, the conditions that modern accelerators create do not exist on Earth otherwise.","With the amount of energy accelerators create, when the particles collide, they break apart.  This enables physicists to examine the building blocks of particles, leading to the change of prior models of the atom.","The high-energy states also allow physicists to create conditions that no longer exist, such as those that existed at the time of the coming into being of the Universe, called the Big Bang.  At that point, matter was highly compressed and hot. Accelerators allow for research into new areas of science and the testing of theories of matter and the fundamental forces."],"objNames":["wb_particle_accelerator_5"]}
