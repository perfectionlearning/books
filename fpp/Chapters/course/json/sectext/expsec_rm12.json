You should be conducting labs as part of your studies − you will be “doing” science.  We explain here the essentials of “what is science.”","The National Academy of Sciences is an organization of elite U.S. scientists and foreign associates.  It advises the country on scientific matters.  The group defines science as \"use of evidence to construct testable explanations and predictions of natural phenomena, as well as the knowledge generated through this process.\"","Science creates testable explanations based on evidence.  These explanations are called hypotheses and theories. Scientists create hypotheses, ways to explain what scientists observe and to predict future observations. For a hypothesis to be accepted as true and to become a well-accepted theory, scientists must be able to test it. ","Science generates predictions of future behavior. It predicts what scientists will observe. For instance, Albert Einstein’s theory of special relativity predicted that time should pass more slowly for a fast-moving object than for a stationary observer. It took decades before technology developed enough to test his hypotheses. ","As scientists do their work, they generate knowledge about the world we live in. Einstein’s relativity work contributed to many fields, from astronomy to satellite communication.","Science is the study of natural phenomena, the events that occur in nature. For instance, science can be used to construct a nuclear bomb and to calculate the damage it may cause, but science alone cannot say whether it is right or wrong to use such a weapon."],"objNames":["wb_nature_of_science1"]}
