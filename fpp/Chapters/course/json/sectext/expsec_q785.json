Because the sides of the loop are current-carrying wires, they experience forces as they move through the magnetic field, and the entire loop experiences a resulting torque. You can see the direction of the forces in the sketch. This torque goes in the direction opposite to the torque used to turn the crank, which is why it is referred to as a countertorque. ","A generator of this type produces what is called an alternating current, one that changes back and forth in direction over time. In the lower diagram, we show the symbol used in circuit diagrams for an alternating current (AC) generator. "],"objNames":["wb_e_generator_concept3","wb_e_generator_concepts4"]}
