    "In a matter of decades, matter waves changed from a theoretical concept to an applied technology. ",
    "The laws of wave optics dictate a limit on the resolution of an image that is created by “viewing” at a given wavelength. Microscopes that use visible light cannot resolve objects much smaller than the wavelength of visible light, roughly 1000 nanometers. Electrons can have a wavelength much smaller than that of visible light. A transmission electron microscope takes advantage of this smaller wavelength and can resolve objects with sizes on the order of 0.1 nanometer!",

In the TEM image, you see the salivary gland of a mosquito that has been infected by the Eastern equine encephalitis virus, which causes sleeping sickness. The individual viruses are artificially colored red and are about 60 nanometers in diameter. Even smaller details are visible in the image. "
