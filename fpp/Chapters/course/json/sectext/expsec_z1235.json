With solar panels, the return is saving the cost of paying a utility for electricity.  Over the years, the savings from those bills can pay back the initial cost of the panels. The question for this section is: How many years? A faster payback is better.<br \/><br \/>We start with an estimate for power in one African country, Somalia.  Electrical energy costs about $0.18 per kilowatt hour.  Since the price is quoted in kilowatt hours, we calculate how many kilowatt hours the container farm will require per year.  Multiplying that energy requirement in kWh by the cost of electrical energy per kWh, we calculate the annual cost of electricity for the farm, if we had to buy it from the utility. ","We then divide the cost of the solar panels by the annual cost of electricity to determine how many years it will take to pay back the investment in solar panels.  This is one way to determine whether an investment is worth pursuing.  As a rough rule of thumb, an investment with a payback of fewer than 10 years might be viewed as a good one, while one taking longer than that might be viewed as an investment to avoid.  ","As we mentioned earlier, the cost of the solar power system might be higher than our estimate.  If so, this would increase the time required to pay for the system.  We also mentioned that one downside to solar power is that the lights are required to be on for about 16 hours\/day, which is longer than the sun typically shines.  Using electricity from the utility, perhaps as a supplement to a battery system, is an option to address this shortcoming."],"objNames":["wb_solar_power_costs"]}
