In both cases, the right hand side is the product of the normal force and the appropriate coefficient of friction. ","With static friction, the force of friction is equal to the force that is pushing or pulling on the object, parallel to the contact surface, up to a limit, which equals the product of the coefficient of static friction and the normal force.  ","The force of static friction is just great enough to prevent motion (as long as the limit is not passed), but not greater. (If it were greater, the object would start accelerating on its own in the direction of the frictional force!) ","Once the object moves, then kinetic friction is the relevant form of friction.  Its magnitude equals the product of the normal force and the coefficient of kinetic friction. ","The table shows some coefficients of friction: Static if the objects are not sliding past one another, and kinetic if they are."],"objNames":["wb_static_friction_calculation","wb_table_static_friction_calculation"]}
