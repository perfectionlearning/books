In this case, energy is added in the form of a photon approaching the atom. We show the photon as the \u201csquiggle\u201d that approaches from the right. The atom absorbs the energy and the electron jumps to an orbit of greater radius, a more energetic one. The electron moves directly and instantaneously from one orbit to another.  The electron does not exist between the orbits.","When we add more energy in the form of another photon, The atom absorbs it and the electron jumps to an orbit with an even larger radius and energy. It moves instantaneously from one orbital radius to another. And again, we stress that this is <b>unlike<\/b> a satellite circling Earth. A satellite would move gradually between the two orbits. ","The orbits are quantized. They are not continuous in terms of location, but exist only at certain, specific radii.  This is true whether energy is being absorbed or emitted by the atom as it absorbs or emits photons. "],"objNames":["wb_bohr2"]}
