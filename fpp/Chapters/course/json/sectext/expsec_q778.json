","Magnetic flux is the quantity of magnetic field that passes through a surface. In the section, we assume the field is perpendicular to the surface, as we show in the diagram.  (If the field is not perpendicular, there will be less flux). ","Flux depends on the field strength at the surface. The closeness of the magnetic field lines indicates the strength of the magnetic field, so the more lines you see passing through a given surface, the greater the flux through that surface.","The amount of flux increases with surface area. We show a magnetic field. The orange lines represent the part of the field that is passing through the surface.  ","The equation shows how to calculate magnetic flux when the field is perpendicular to the surface area.  It equals the product of the magnetic field and the surface area.  Flux is represented by Φ, the Greek letter phi.   ","The unit for magnetic flux is the weber, which is equivalent to teslas multiplied by meters. It is named after the German physicist Wilhelm Eduard Weber (1804 − 1891), one of the inventors of the telegraph. "],"objNames":["wb_magnetic_flux","wb_magnetic_flux_equation"]}
