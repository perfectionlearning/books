It is accelerating. The acceleration gauge shows this acceleration.","Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. For example, if we accelerate at just 1 meter per second squared, the car\u2019s velocity changes relatively slowly.  Every second, its positive velocity increases by one meter per second.","When we increase that acceleration to 3 meters per second squared, the velocity changes more quickly, at 3 meters per second, every second.","Like velocity, acceleration is a <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_vector_definition'>vector<\/a> \u2212 it has a direction.  For example, we consider what occurs if the initial velocity is positive 27 meters per second and the acceleration is negative 2 meters per second squared.  The acceleration causes the car to slow down, turn around, and then its velocity becomes increasingly negative. It moves faster and faster in the negative direction."],"objNames":["actwb_acceleration_definition"]}
