","A closed end acts as a displacement node. The particles have no displacement there because the end of the pipe blocks their motion. ","With one end closed, the longest possible wavelength occurs when the pipe is one-fourth the wavelength of the wave, as we show in the diagram. This means the longest standing wavelength is four times the length of the pipe.  ","The next harmonic occurs when the wavelength is four-thirds the length of the pipe. The third longest harmonic occurs at four-fifths the pipe length.","We show how to compute the frequencies for this type of pipe. Its harmonics are at <b>odd</b>-valued integer multiples of the fundamental frequency, as in three, five, or seven times.  This differs from the case of a pipe with both ends open.
