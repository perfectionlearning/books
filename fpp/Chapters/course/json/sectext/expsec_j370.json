","The bristles of a dry paintbrush can spread outward. In contrast, the bristles of a wet paintbrush move together because of the surface tension of the water they hold. The surface of the liquid contracts, pulling the bristles together. ","In liquids such as water, molecules have negatively and positively charged regions that attract each other. For water molecules below the surface, these forces exist in all directions, so there is no net force on any interior molecule. ","For water molecules at the surface, there are no molecules above them. This means there is a net force pulling them inward and causing the surface to contract. This is called “surface tension.”","The spherical nature of dewdrops on the rose is due to surface tension.  The force of surface tension causes the water to minimize its surface area, with that surface area minimized in the form of a sphere. ","The surface tension of a pond supports the weight of the water strider. As it moves across the water, its weight causes its feet to depress the surface, but not to break through. The surface tension provides a force that balances the insect’s weight."],"objNames":["wb_surface_tension_concepts","wb_waterstrider_concepts"]}
