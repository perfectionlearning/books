He says that a change in motion \u2212 that is, an acceleration \u2212 occurs in the direction of a net force, and is proportional to the force.  Acceleration increases with force.","Newton also pointed out that the acceleration occurs in the same direction as the net force.","The way the law is stated today also mentions mass \u2212 the greater the mass, the less the acceleration. ","The equation for Newton\u2019s second law says that the net force on an object equals the product of mass and acceleration.  This is a very common way to write the law. ","We also can rewrite the equation by solving for the acceleration.  This lets us see mathematically how acceleration increases with force and decreases with mass.
