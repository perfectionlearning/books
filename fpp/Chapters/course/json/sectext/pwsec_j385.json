As the diagram shows, when someone blows above the paper, it lifts the paper up.  ","Why?  The height of the flowing air is constant, so only two factors can change, pressure and kinetic energy, which increase with speed.","Since the speed in flowing air is higher than in still air, the pressure must be less than in still air.  This means the force on the top surface of the paper is less than the force below, where the air is still, and the paper rises up. "],"objNames":["wb_bernoulli_applied1"]}
