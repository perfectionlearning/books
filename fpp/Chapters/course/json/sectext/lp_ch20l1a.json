[OBJ:expsec_t555:Reflection] can be applied to types of waves, such as light and water waves. Reflection is the change of direction of a wave at the boundary between two materials, with the wave continuing in the original material.<br />2. [OBJ:expsec_t557:Plane mirrors] are flat mirrors. In reflection, an [OBJ:expsec_t557:object] is the source of the light, while the [OBJ:expsec_t557:image] is the reproduction of the object. <br />3. [OBJ:expsec_t558:Virtual images] appear on the opposite side of the mirror as the object. [OBJ:expsec_t558:Real images] appear on the same side of the mirror as the object.<br />4. The Law of Reflection states that the [OBJ:expsec_t561:angle of incidence] of a ray is equal to the angle of reflection of a ray.<br />5. [OBJ:expsec_t563:Ray diagrams] are used to determine the position and type of image formed by the mirror.","  <b>Vocabulary:</b>  [OBJ:expsec_t555:reflection], [OBJ:expsec_t556:specular reflection], [OBJ:expsec_t556:diffuse reflection], [OBJ:expsec_t557:plane mirror], [OBJ:expsec_t557:object, image], [OBJ:expsec_t558:virtual image], [OBJ:expsec_t558:real image], [OBJ:pwsec_t559:optical illusion], [OBJ:expsec_t560:light rays], [OBJ:expsec_t561:law of reflection], [OBJ:expsec_t561:incident ray], [OBJ:expsec_t561:normal], [OBJ:expsec_t563:ray diagram], [OBJ:expsec_t563:virtual ray]","  <b>STEM Skills:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1.
