Although the focus of this unit is on electric fields, we discuss the concept of fields first using gravitational fields, since we are more accustomed to gravitational force. ","Fields are used to describe forces that act at a distance.  We use Jupiter, a massive planet, as an example.  Due to its great mass, Jupiter will apply a strong gravitational force on any mass that comes near it. ","We can use the idea of a field to show this.  The potential to exert a force on any nearby object always exists, whether an object is there or not.","We then can use the idea of a “test mass” − some mass we will use to measure the amount of force.  A satellite will be our test mass.","We use a field line, complete with an arrow, to show the direction of the force. ","Scientists draw lines closer together to indicate where the field is stronger.  The force on the satellite − our system for measuring the field − is stronger closer to the planet.  ","The field diagram is a map of the strength of the gravitational force.  We do not have to be specific about our test mass, the satellite.  Whether its mass is 100 kilograms, or 10,000 kilograms, the field diagram predicts the relative strength of gravity at different locations.  "],"objNames":["wb_field_concept1"]}
