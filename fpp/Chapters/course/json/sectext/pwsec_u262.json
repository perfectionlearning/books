Here, we discuss how refraction explains some visual effects associated with water. ","The fisherman you see is trying to spear a fish for dinner. The light traveling from the fish to the fisherman’s eyes refracts away from the normal when it passes from water into air.","Since the fisherman assumes that light moves in a straight line, he assumes the fish is higher in the water than it actually is. Refraction may cause him to throw his spear above the fish’s location in the water.","The fish’s view of the world is also affected by refraction. The lower illustration shows two light rays being refracted at the surface of the water, and coming down to the fish. The dotted lines show what the fish’s “cone of vision” would be if there were no refraction. Refraction increases the fish’s range of vision: He gets a wide-angle view of the world above. ","Photographs can be taken with a lens, called a fish-eye lens, which creates an effect similar to what a fish looking up out of the water sees. Because such a wide-angle view includes more content from the edge, it becomes especially compressed there."],"objNames":["wb_refraction_applied_concepts1","wb_refraction_applied_concepts2"]}
