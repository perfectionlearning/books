Lenses in eyeglasses and contact lenses are worn by about 60% of the population of the United States, and this percentage is projected to increase as the population ages.","In this section, you can begin your experimentation with lenses. The convex lens will produce an image of the penguin. You can move the penguin left and right to see how its distance from the lens changes the resulting image.","Use the activity to answer the barrage of questions that follow.  Where must the object be relative to the focal point F to create an image on the same side of the lens as the object? Where must it be to create an image on the far side? (Use the focal point F on the same side of the lens as the object when answering the first two questions.) ","Can you make the image appear right-side up (rather than inverted, as it is in the picture on the left)? A note: When the object is very near the focal point, the image will be too far away from the lens to be shown in the simulationâ€™s window."],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_37_0"]}
