Vision is an application of lenses. In the [OBJ:expsec_u276:human eye], the ciliary muscle can change the curvature of the lens, which changes the focal length of the lens, which allows what a human views to be in focus.<br />2. [OBJ:pwsec_u279:Glasses] and [OBJ:expsec_u280:laser eye surgery] are also applications of lenses. Glasses can be either converging or diverging lenses. As diverging lenses, they spread light out before the light reaches the eye, which allows for the light to focus farther back in the eye than it would without the glasses. Laser eye surgery reduces the curvature of the lens of the eye, which changes the focal point of the eye.<br />3.
