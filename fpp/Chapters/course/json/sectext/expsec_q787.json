A simple transformer includes two coils in separate circuits. The coils wrap around a common iron core to channel the magnetic field from one through the other. A transformer can increase or decrease a potential difference by means of induction. First, we will discuss how the potential difference is induced, and then discuss why it changes.","The alternating current flowing through the coil on the left creates a changing magnetic field that, transmitted through the iron core, passes through the coil on the right. As the amount of current increases or decreases, so does the magnetic field created by the current.","The changing magnetic flux induces the potential difference shown in the circuit on the right, according to Faraday\u2019s law. This potential difference drives an alternating current in the right-hand circuit."],"objNames":["wb_transformer_concepts1"]}
