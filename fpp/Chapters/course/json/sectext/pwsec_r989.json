For instance, one very popular cell phone had 153,600 pixels.  A later cell phone, which had a larger screen, had 727,040 pixels.","In part, the increased numbers of pixels are being spread over larger screens.  But the increase in pixels also is being used to increase pixel density − the number of pixels per square inch.  For instance, an earlier cell phone had 163 pixels per square inch. ","In contrast, a later cell phone had 326 pixels per square inch. The manufacturer says the pixels are so close together that the human eye does not know the image is formed from separate pixels, but rather perceives a continuous image.   This is often stated as “no jaggies” − no steplike lines on a curve. "],"objNames":["wb_display_technology1","wb_pixels_density"]}
