Nuclear weapons, transistors that allow computers to function, lasers − all are based on quantum physics. ","Quantum is an adjective to describe things that exist only at certain values − they are quantized. Pennies describe a quantum in our currency. You cannot make change of less than a penny, and other values are a multiple of a penny. $1.25, for instance, equals 125 pennies. ","Eggs are also quantized. You cannot buy 3.01345 eggs at a store.  ","The opposite of quantized is continuous. Real numbers are continuous. The diagram shows that there is a range of numbers between 3 and 3.1, and you can put as many real numbers between these two values as you like, such as 3.06512 or a number with a thousand digits after the 2 in that number.  Real numbers are continuous, not quantized."],"objNames":["wb_quantum_concepts","wb_quantum_2"]}
