{"cards":[{"lines":[{"type":"title","text":"Human cannonball"}]}],"definitions":[],"secText":["You get to have the role of a human cannonball.  Please don’t do this with your own home cannon.  You set the initial angle of the cannon using the slider on the left in the activity.  The angle is displayed in the upper left. ","You set the initial speed with the slider on the right.  The number line shows some targets that you can aim at − you will get another chance at this later when you learn more about projectile motion.","One thing you will notice is that the axes in this activity match the situation. The <i>x</i>-axis represents how far along the ground you have moved from the cannon.  The <i>y</i>-axis is now up and down − how far off the ground you are.  ","For now, answer some questions about projectile motion.  Does the <i>x</i>-velocity change as you fly through the air?  (Air resistance is ignored in this simulation.)  Does the <i>y</i>-velocity change?  Can you explain why one velocity component changes and the other does not?   (Hint: Think about what is required for a velocity change.)"],"objNames":["unityact_cannon"]}
