For example, the number 1.25 has three digits.","If a digit is anything other than zero, it is significant. So 3, 5, 8, and so on, are significant digits. ","Zero is significant if it lies between digits other than zero.  This means it is not significant in examples such as 250 or 0.0032, but it is significant in 305. ","A trailing zero is a final zero to the right of the decimal point, such as the zero in 9.80. The zero is written in this number to emphasize that there are 3 significant digits. ","Two types of numbers have special properties.  One type includes constants, like <i><span class=\"Symbols\">Ï€</span></i>, or a fraction such as one-half, that are part of an equation and considered to be exact.  The other special type includes numbers known as counts, such as 9 innings in a baseball game.","These numbers do not change or determine the number of significant digits. Other numbers in the calculation determine the number of significant digits. "],"objNames":["wb_significant_figures_number_of","wb_math_significant_figures_constants_counts"]}
