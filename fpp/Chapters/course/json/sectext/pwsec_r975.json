Given how common computer circuits are, how they are manufactured is an area of ongoing research in industry.  Diffraction plays an important role in limiting the ability to manufacture smaller, more powerful circuits.  To explain why, we start by explaining how computer circuits are manufactured. ","The first step in creating a circuit is to create a mask by etching away parts of an opaque (nontransparent) material. The mask functions as a radiation stencil for the circuit pattern. The mask matches the circuits that a circuit designer wants created, just as we might use a stencil to create letters in a sign. ","The mask is placed in front of a light-sensitive layer of material, known as resist, that is on top of the chip material. Where radiation passes through the mask, it causes a chemical reaction in the light-sensitive resist material. The exposed regions are chemically developed and removed, forming a stencil. Then, metal can be deposited through the narrow openings in the resist to form the circuits.  A lift-off process then removes all of the undeveloped resist and unwanted metal. The design has been transferred from the reusable mask to the circuit that will ship as part of a computer, cell phone, or other electronic device.
