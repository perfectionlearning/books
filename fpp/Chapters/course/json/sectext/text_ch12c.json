The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy (randomness) of a system always increases or remains constant.<br \/>15. As the temperature of an ideal gas increases, so does its kinetic energy. To calculate the average kinetic energy of a molecule, multiply Boltzmann's constant, by the temperature of the gas in Kelvins, by 3\/2.<br \/>16. Since there are so many atoms that compose an amount of gas, we use the average velocity to approximate the speed of the molecules in the gas. To find the average velocity of molecules in a gas, take the root-mean-square.","  <b>Vocabulary:<\/b> adiabatic, efficiency, engine, first law of thermodynamics, heat engine, heat pump, isobaric, refrigerator, root-mean-square, second law of thermodynamics (engines), entropy, second law of thermodynamics (entropy)","  <b>STEM Skills:<\/b>  <b>    <br \/>  <\/b>1.
