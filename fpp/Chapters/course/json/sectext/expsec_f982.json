Their power rating, in watts, describes how many joules of electrical energy are turned into heat and light every second. In a 100-watt (100 W) bulb, 100 joules of electrical energy become heat and light every second. ","One equation for power is the same as the definition − energy divided by time, which is to say the rate of energy transfer. ","We can also relate power to work. Power is the rate at which work is done: the work done divided by the elapsed time time.   For instance, if 200 joules of work is done on a system at a constant rate over 5 seconds, the power is 200 divided by 5, which is to say 40 watts. ","The unit for power is the watt. One watt is one joule per second. "],"objNames":["wb_power_concept","wb_power_equation10"]}
