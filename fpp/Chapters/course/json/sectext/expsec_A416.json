When the filament is heated, electrons are set free by the increase in thermal energy. The electrons are accelerated and guided through the vacuum of the CRT by an electromagnetic field, which is generated by charged plates and coils of wires. ","The television screen acts as a particle detector. The high-energy electrons hit the back of the screen, which contains phosphorescent materials that glow in different colors. The incoming electrons are detected and made visible in the color pixels that make up the image."],"objNames":["wb_CRT1","wb_CRT12"]}
