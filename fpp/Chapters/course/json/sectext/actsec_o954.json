{"cards":[{"lines":[{"type":"title","text":"Electric force"}]}],"definitions":[],"secText":["We start our discussion of electric force with the simulation in this section. The simulation allows you to experiment with positively and negatively charged particles and see the forces they apply on one another. The positively charged particles in this simulation have the same charge as protons, and the negatively charged particles have the same charge as electrons.","After you launch this simulation, drag particles from the control panel onto the screen above it. The amount and direction of the force applied on each particle will be shown on the screen. ","Some questions you should answer: How does the direction of force change with the type of charges?  For example, replace an electron with a proton at the same location, and see if the direction of the force changes. Does the amount? Also, you can observe how force changes with distance.  If you double the distance between two charges, does the amount of force fall by a factor of two, or by some other factor?  "],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_23_0_1"]}
