We will discuss timbre shortly.","A pitch essentially describes a pure tone \u2212 a note of a single frequency.  Some people are said to have \u201cperfect pitch\u201d \u2212 the ability to exactly hear, identify, and sometimes reproduce a certain note. In reality, the note they hear typically is not a pure tone, but more complex, and they are describing a sound dominated by a fundamental frequency. ","Audio engineers and musicians know that we react differently to different pitches.  Low-frequency sounds can make music sound powerful and warm.  Midrange frequencies, where we are most sensitive to sound, give it energy.  Higher-frequency notes can add excitement. "],"objNames":["wb_pitch"]}
