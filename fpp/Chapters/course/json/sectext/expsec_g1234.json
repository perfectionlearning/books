For instance, the dot plot shows that 8 samples were positively charged \u2212 this means the frequency was 8.","Histograms use bars to represent frequency. Tall bars indicate that a value, or range of values, is more common. A histogram is easier to create than a dot plot when the amount of data grows larger. The histogram shows the frequency distribution of the masses of 70 samples.","The height of the bar reflects the frequency of weights in different ranges. For instance, the bar above the interval from 120 to 130 shows that five samples have a mass ranging from 120 to 130 grams. "],"objNames":["wb_graph_dots","wb_histogram"]}
