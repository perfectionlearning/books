Objects float because of the upward buoyant force of a fluid like water.","The amount of buoyant force equals the weight of the displaced fluid. In the illustration, the wood block is less dense than water, so when it is partly submerged, the weight of the water it displaces is equal to the block\u2019s weight. This is a fancy way of saying it floats!","We can state Archimedes\u2019 principle as an equation. The buoyant force is equal to the fluid density multiplied by the displaced volume multiplied by the freefall acceleration."],"objNames":["wb_archimedes_concepts2","wb_archimedes_concepts"]}
