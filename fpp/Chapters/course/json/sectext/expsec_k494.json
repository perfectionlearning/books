","The volume of most materials, including fluids, increases as their temperature increases. For instance, the volume of the coolant in an automobile radiator increases as the engine gets hotter. Most radiators have an overflow tank to capture coolant when it expands to a volume greater than the radiator’s capacity.","Every substance has a coefficient of volume expansion that determines the relative expansion in volume for that substance for a given temperature increase. ","Just as with linear thermal expansion, the expansion in volume is proportional to the initial size, which is volume in this case.","The change in volume is equal to the initial volume times the coefficient of volume expansion <i>β</i> times the change in temperature, measured in kelvins or Celsius degrees."],"objNames":["wb_thermal_volume_expansion_concepts","wb_volume_expansion_equation"]}
