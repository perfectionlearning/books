First we discuss angles measured with radians.","In the study of rotational motion, position is described using angles. The angular position of the bicycle wheel is indicated with <i><math xmlns:xsl=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\"><mi>θ</mi></math></i>. The angle is measured from the three o’clock position, which is the positive <i>x</i>-axis. The angle is positive when the rotation is counterclockwise.","When the wheel is rotated clockwise, its angular position is negative.","Radians are the usual units for angular position. The angular position of the valve in the illustration is <i><span class=\"Symbols\">π</span></i>/4 radians (which equals 45°). ","One reason that radians are so convenient is the relationship shown by this equation. By dividing the length of the arc, represented by <i>s</i>, by the radius <i>r</i>, you obtain the radian measure of the angle.
