We now show the wave, and the wavelets that make it up, passing through a slit in a barrier.","Since each wavelet is bordered by wavelets above or below it, the wave front moves as a straight line. ","When the wave collides with the wall, only some of the wave front and the wavelets that make it up can pass through the slit. ","Once the wavelets pass through the slit, the vibrating particles that are the sources of the wavelets at the top and bottom can interact with particles above and below them, causing them to be the source of wavelets as well.","As the wave front expands, more particles become the sources of spherical wavelets. The result is a spherical wave front."],"objNames":["wb_huygen_concepts3","wb_huygren_concepts4"]}
