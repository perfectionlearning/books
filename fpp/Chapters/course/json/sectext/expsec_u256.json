It can be used to determine how much waves will refract when entering or exiting that material from or into another material with a known index of refraction.","Light travels fastest in a vacuum, and slower in materials.  The index of refraction of a material is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed of light in that material. The speed of light in a vacuum is represented with <i>c<\/i>.  The speed of light in a vacuum is exactly 299,792,458 m\/s, typically approximated as 3.00\u00d710<sup class=\"\">8<\/sup> m\/s. As we mentioned, this is the maximum speed of light, and does not change based on the motion of the source or observer.","Since the speed of light is greatest in a vacuum, the index of refraction of any material is greater than one. The slower light travels in a material, the greater the material\u2019s index of refraction.","The index of refraction is represented by <i>n<\/i>.  We show the equation that defines the index, with <i>n<\/i> equal to the speed of light in a vacuum divided by the speed of light in a material.
