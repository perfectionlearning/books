The spreadsheet allows for more precision since it can calculate many small rectangles, leading to more accurate results.","Before discussing how to calculate areas, we mention briefly how to use a spreadsheet to generate a normal curve. To understand this, you need to know the basics of spreadsheets −concepts such as cell references, formulas and functions − information that is outside the range of this textbook. You can find good tutorials on spreadsheet basics on the Web. It’s also a bit of a challenge to see the spreadsheet if you are reading this and looking at the graphic to the left, so we encourage you to click on the card and play it.","In cell B1, we specify that the curve is to be displayed starting at 0. In B3, we note that its mean is 4, and in B4, that its standard deviation is 1.5.  The computer then drew the curve you see. ","The values starting in A6 and below are the <i>x</i>-values, the points you see on the horizontal axis.  We asked for points with an increment (difference) between them by specifying the step size, 0.1, in the cell B2.  Those will be the boundaries of the rectangles the computer uses:0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and so on. If we had picked a smaller increment, the rectangles would have been narrower.","The values in column B, starting in cell B6 and below, are the values of the curve.  For instance, for <i>x</i> = 0.2, the value of the curve is 0.010745239. "],"objNames":["wb_spreadsheet_normal_curve2","wb_spreadsheet_normal_curve5"]}
