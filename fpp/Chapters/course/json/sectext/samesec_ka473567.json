    "First, can the helicopter have a negative acceleration and a positive net force? A negative velocity and a positive net force? If so, explain how by demonstrating some specific examples. ",
    "Next, what net force must be applied to the helicopter if it is moving at 2.04 m/s, with zero acceleration? Finally, what is the helicopterâ€™s mass?"
