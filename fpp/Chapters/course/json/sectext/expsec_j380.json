The water flows faster. You have discovered fluid flow continuity!   ","Fluid flow continuity means the <b>volume flow rate</b> of a fluid flowing by any point is the same everywhere along the flow. Fluid cannot “just” disappear or appear as it flows. Fluid continuity applies to an ideal fluid, one that flows easily and in a consistent fashion.  It would not apply to motor oil, or a gas that is easily compressed.","Another place one can observe fluid continuity is in rivers.  Water flows more quickly through narrow or shallow channels, called rapids.  Water runs more slowly where the river is broader or deeper."],"objNames":["wb_fluid_continuity_concepts","wb_fluid_continuity_concepts2"]}
