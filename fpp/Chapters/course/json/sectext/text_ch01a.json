How can we use acceleration, velocity, elapsed time, and displacement to understand motion?","  <b>Enduring Understandings:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1. Position is measured relative to an origin.<br />2. Net distance is calculated using the initial and final positions of an object and is always a positive quantity.<br />3. Speed is calculated using the net distance traveled by an object and elapsed time. Speed is always a positive quantity.<br />4. Instantaneous velocity refers to the velocity of an object during a miniscule amount of time.<br />5. Average velocity is the displacement divided by the elapsed time when the elapsed time is not miniscule.<br />6. Analyze an equation for relationships between variables.<br />7. Displacement is a vector. Its magnitude is distance and its direction can be positive or negative. The magnitude of the distance can be positive or zero.<br />8. Velocity is a vector. Its magnitude is speed and its direction can be positive or negative. The magnitude of the speed can be positive or zero.<br />9. Acceleration is a vector. It can be calculated using the change in velocity and elapsed time.<br />10. Changes in acceleration affect an objectâ€™s velocity.<br />11. Acceleration, displacement, and velocity are essential variables in calculating motion.","  <b>Vocabulary:</b> acceleration, average velocity, displacement, distance, elapsed time, instantaneous velocity, magnitude, position, scalar, solving for a variable, speed, vector, velocity "],"objNames":[]}
