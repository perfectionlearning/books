You want to beat the computer car as you drive around the track. ","Halfway around the track, you encounter an oil slick. If the centripetal acceleration of your car is greater than 3.92 m/s<sup class=\"\">2</sup> at this point, it will leave the track and you will lose. The radius of the circle is 21.0 m.  Calculate the maximum speed and round down to the nearest 0.1 m/s. ","In the second activity, the two curves have different radii.  You still want to beat the computer car, but again, if you go too fast, you will slip off the track. The first curve has a radius of 14.0 meters; the second, 8.50 meters. On either curve, if the centripetal acceleration of your car exceeds 9.95 m/s<sup class=\"\">2</sup>, its tires will lose traction on the curve, causing it to leave the track. Again, round down the maximum speed to the nearest 0.1 m/s. ","You will find that the maximum speed differs between the curves.  Why?  Consider how the centripetal acceleration may differ between the curves even though you are traveling at the same speed, and why it does. "],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_9_5_1","jsact_Chapter_9_5_2"]}
