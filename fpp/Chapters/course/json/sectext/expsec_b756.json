It measures how fast something is moving.  The car moves at different speeds, faster and slower.   The speedometer on the lower left shows the car\u2019s speed.","Speed is always zero or a positive number \u2212 it can never be a negative number.  If you think about a car speedometer, you know it starts at zero and displays positive numbers. ","Speed is a <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_math_rate_example'>rate<\/a>, in this case, distance per unit of time.  In the simulation, the car starts at position negative 10 meters, and moves a distance of 150 meters in 10 elapsed seconds.  Dividing the distance of 150 meters by the elapsed time of 10 seconds, we calculate a speed of 15 meters per second.","The equation shows how to calculate speed. The elapsed time is the time during which the distance is traveled.  The triangle you see comes from the Greek alphabet and is pronounced \u201cdelta.\u201d  Delta represents change.  The equation is pronounced <i>d<\/i> divided by delta <i>t<\/i>.
