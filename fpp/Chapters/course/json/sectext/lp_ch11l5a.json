[OBJ:expsec_k478:State changes] are the transformation of matter between states, such as from solid to liquid, liquid to gas, gas to liquid, and liquid to solid. The amount of heat needed for a state change can be calculated using the [OBJ:expsec_k480:latent heat equations].<br />2. The [OBJ:expsec_k482:heating curves] of state changes show the amount of heat needed between states and the increase in temperature that occurs as a result of heat transfer.","  <b>Vocabulary:</b>  [OBJ:expsec_k478:state change], [OBJ:expsec_k479:latent heat]","  <b>STEM Skills:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1.
