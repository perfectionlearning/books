Elastic collisions provide an entertaining way to study energy conservation.  The forces between the objects are the only ones treated as relevant during the collision. ","In an elastic collision, kinetic energy is conserved.  The total kinetic energy of the system remains constant.  ","We use a pair of colliding pool balls to discuss an elastic collision.  Both balls have the same mass, and the yellow ball starts at rest. After the collision, the white ball is at rest, and the yellow ball has the same velocity as the white ball had before the collision.","This means kinetic energy is conserved. Why? Kinetic energy equals half the product of the mass and the square of the velocity. This quantity is the same before and after the collision.  The initial kinetic energy of the white ball equals the final kinetic energy of the yellow ball.  In this example, all of the kinetic energy transfers from one object to another.","The first equation states that kinetic energy is conserved in an elastic collision. In other words, the initial kinetic energy, just before the collision, equals the final kinetic energy, the energy just after the collision.  ","The second equation tells what we know is true of collisions in general: linear momentum is conserved.  The original and final momentums are the same."],"objNames":["wb_elastic_collision_defined","wb_elastic_collision_equation"]}
