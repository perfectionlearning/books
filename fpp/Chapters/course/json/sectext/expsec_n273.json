The photograph shows wave superposition in a pond as the ripples overlap.","A string also provides a simple visual model for discussing superposition.  In the second diagram, we show two wave pulses traveling on the same string. When the pulses meet, they combine to form a pulse with greater amplitude. Then they move apart, continuing in the same directions as before.","The principle of superposition states that we can add the displacement of each wave at any point to calculate the effect of the combined wave. At time <i>t</i> = 1 second, the pulses are moving toward each other. At <i>t</i> = 2 seconds, the pulses have just met. The combined wave pulse equals the sum of the two pulses that cause it. ","To determine the resulting pulse at any time, we can add the displacements of the pulses that combine to form it at each position. When the two pulses meet exactly at <span class=\"math\"><i>t</i> = 2.5</span> seconds, the height of the resulting peak is the sum of the heights of the two individual peaks.","After the pulses combine to form a large peak, they continue moving past each other, as you see at the time <i>t</i> = 4 seconds. At all times, the combined wave is the sum of the individual pulses’ displacements."],"objNames":["wb_superposition_conceptspre1","wb_superposition_concepts1"]}
