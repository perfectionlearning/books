[OBJ:expsec_v054:Elements] are the building blocks of matter. Elements are composed of [OBJ:expsec_v054:atoms].<br />2. The [OBJ:expsec_v055:plum pudding model] of the atom is an early model of the atom. The plum pudding model stated that positive charge was evenly distributed throughout the atom, much like plums in plum pudding. [OBJ:expsec_v056:Ernest Rutherford] proved otherwise. Rutherford shot alpha particles at gold foil. He found that the alpha particles were reflected and changed direction differently than expected. He concluded that in the middle of an atom, there exists a nucleus that is composed of protons of positive charge. The nucleus is surrounded by orbits that contain electrons.<br />3. Two components of the nucleus of an atom are [OBJ:expsec_v057:neutrons and protons]. Protons have positive charge, while neutrons have no charge.<br />4. Elements are identified by the number of protons that exist within the nucleus. [OBJ:expsec_v058:Isotopes] of elements contain the same number of protons, but different numbers of neutrons.","  <b>Vocabulary:</b>  [OBJ:expsec_v054:elements], [OBJ:expsec_v054:atom], [OBJ:expsec_v056:nucleus], [OBJ:expsec_v057:neutron], [OBJ:expsec_v057:nucleons], [OBJ:expsec_v058:isotope]","  <b>STEM Skills:</b>  <b>    <br />  </b>1.
