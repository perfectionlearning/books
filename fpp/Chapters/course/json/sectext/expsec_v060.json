The other two fundamental forces are the strong and weak forces. The strong force acts only over a very short distance, about a nuclear diameter, and it holds together the nucleus, balancing the repulsive electrostatic force that would cause protons to fly away from one another. Both neutrons and protons experience the strong force. ","The strong force and the electrostatic force are the two dominant forces within a nucleus.  Protons repel one another. There is no electrostatic force between protons and the neutral neutrons.  The strong force causes neutrons and protons to attract one another.  This accounts for the role of neutrons in the stability of the nucleus.  Neutrons provide an attractive force, but no repulsive force.  They play an important role in holding together the larger nuclei, such as those of uranium.","The final fundamental force is the nuclear weak force.  In certain circumstances, it transforms neutrons, turning them into protons, electrons, and antineutrinos. Neutrons are stable inside of most nuclei, but are unstable as free particles. The force is called the “weak force” because at ordinary temperatures, it is weak compared to the strong and electromagnetic forces.  It is a key player in nuclear fusion, the process that generates the energy of the Sun. "],"objNames":["wb_four_forces_strong","wb_four_forces_weak"]}
