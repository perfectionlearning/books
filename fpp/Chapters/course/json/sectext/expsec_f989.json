Friction is an example of a non-conservative force."}],"secText":["This roller coaster car does not have enough energy to return to the top of the first big hill by itself. That is because we have added friction to the situation, and friction is a non-conservative force. Friction slows the car whether it is going up a hill or down a hill, forward or backward. Friction is removing kinetic energy from the car − and turning it into heat, for example, which enters the atmosphere.   ","When calculating the work done by a non-conservative force, the path of an object does matter.  The farther the car travels, the more friction reduces the energy of the car. You see this when friction (and air resistance) causes an object to come to a stop.  The farther an object moves, the more such forces reduce its mechanical energy."],"objNames":["wb_non_conservative_force"]}
