In the original version of this game, you are given glasses, some filled with water and others empty. By pouring liquid, you are asked to end up with an asked-for final amount of water.","In the simulations to the left, the same overall idea applies to electric charge. You are supplied with a combination of charges on rods. Some of the rods have no net charge, some have positive charge, and some are negatively charged. All the rods are the same size and are made of identical material. In this game, charge flows until equilibrium is reached. For example, if you touch a rod with +4.000 microcoulombs of charge to a rod with no net charge, both rods end up with +2.000 microcoulombs of charge.","To play the game, click on any rod and drag it to another rod. When you release the mouse button, charge will transfer between the rods.  The minimum number of turns required to finish the first challenge is two. ","The second challenge is like the first, but quite a bit harder to figure out. The minimum number of steps to achieve the goal is five.
