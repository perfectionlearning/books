This occurs on the ocean floor, which makes up about 70% of the Earth’s surface.","The Earth’s crust has other features that are due to geologic processes.  To explain, we start with the fact that the Earth’s surface is made up of about two dozen massive pieces called “plates.”  The seven largest make up the majority of the Earth’s surface. The plates in essence “float” over part of the mantle. Where they collide, mountain ranges are formed.  For instance, a collision of plates that started 50 million years ago is the source of the Himalayas.  ","When they diverge (pull apart), vast oceanic ridges are formed. The plates spread at a speed of 2 to 15 centimeters a year − which may seem slow − but this process has caused all the ocean floors to be formed over the past 200 million years.
