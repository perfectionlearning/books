However, Einstein said that light also had to be thought of as a stream of packets of energy. Here, we represent violet light with packets of purple balls.  ","Einstein stated that light is quantized − for any given frequency and wavelength, that is, color, it comes in a fundamental packet, the photon, that cannot be subdivided. ","He stated that brighter, more intense light of a given color consists of more photons. The energy of the individual photons is exactly the same. As you can see, the more intense light on top consists of more photons. All the photons of this violet light are identical.","This model for intensity is analogous to increasing the kinetic energy of a train only by adding more identical train cars, instead of having the original cars move faster (or, to use a wave analogy, oscillate with greater amplitude). ","The energy of a photon is proportional to the frequency of the light.  The energy of a photon can be calculated by using the equation shown in this section.","The energy of a photon equals the product of Planck’s constant and the frequency of the light.  The equation reflects the fundamental relationship between light frequency and photon energy. To stress the point, any photon of light of the same frequency will have the same energy.  It is the number of photons of this frequency of light that determines the light’s intensity. "],"objNames":["wb_photon_2","wb_planck_concepts"]}
