However, Einstein said that light also had to be thought of as a stream of packets of energy. Here, we represent violet light with packets of purple balls.  ","Einstein stated that light is quantized \u2212 for any given frequency and wavelength, that is, color, it comes in a fundamental packet, the photon, that cannot be subdivided. ","He stated that brighter, more intense light of a given color consists of more photons than dimmer light of the same color. The energy of the individual photons is exactly the same. As you can see, the more intense light on top consists of more photons. All the photons of this violet light are identical.","This model for intensity is analogous to increasing the kinetic energy of a train by adding more train cars, instead of moving the original cars faster (or, in a wave analogy, oscillate with greater amplitude). ","The energy of a photon is proportional to the frequency of the light.  The energy of a photon can be calculated by using the equation shown. ","The energy of a photon equals the product of Planck\u2019s constant and the frequency.  The equation reflects the relationship between frequency and photon energy. To stress the point, any photon of the same frequency will have the same energy. It is the number of photons of any frequency of light that determines its intensity. ","This equation relates the frequency (and wavelength) of the electromagnetic spectrum to the energy.  Higher frequency (lower wavelength) spectrum has greater energy per photon."],"objNames":["wb_photon_2","wb_planck_concepts"]}
