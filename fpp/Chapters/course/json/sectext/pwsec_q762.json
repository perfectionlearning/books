It relies on the relationship of fields and moving charged particles. Charges are fired horizontally through the selector. If they do not have the correct speed, they will be accelerated up or down, and will be trapped inside the selector. ","The velocity selector makes use of both an electric field and a magnetic field. Each field applies its own force on the moving particle. The strengths of the fields are set to determine the speed of the charged particles that pass through the selector tube without being deflected.","How does it work?  We will start with the electric force. Oppositely charged plates at the top and bottom of the tube create the electric field. This field applies a force on any charged particle between the plates. In this diagram, the force on the negatively charged particle points upward, toward the positive plate.","The magnetic field applies a force on a moving charge. The magnetic field is pointing into the screen, and the velocity points to the right, so by the right-hand rule the force on a positive particle would be upward, and on a negative particle, downward. When the electric and magnetic forces are equal in magnitude, they balance and the particle will pass through the tube without being deflected. "],"objNames":["wb_velocity_selector_concepts"]}
