","In dimensional analysis, a dimension is a type of unit.  ","Examples of dimensions include time, length, and mass.   For instance, seconds, hours, and years are all units of “time.” ","A simple dimensional analysis could consider the dimension of volume.  Volume is the product of height, width, and depth, which are all lengths.  Volume has the dimension L<sup class=\"\">3</sup>.
