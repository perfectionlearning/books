They are used to store energy in devices ranging from camera flashes to defibrillators, the systems used to \u201cshock\u201d the human heart back into its proper rhythm.","The diagram shows the design of a basic capacitor. It consists of two conducting plates separated by air. There is a wire connected to each plate, and these wires are attached to a source of potential difference that has caused the plates to become charged. The amounts of charge on the plates are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.","You use the simulation to conduct an experiment that demonstrates one of the capacitor\u2019s fundamental properties. You change the potential difference across the plates with the \u0394V controller. When you change the potential difference, note what happens to the amount of charge stored by the capacitor. Is the charge proportional to the potential difference?"],"objNames":["jsact_Chapter_28_0"]}
