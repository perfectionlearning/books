Pun intended.","The device shown in the diagram is a defibrillator. It is a life-saving apparatus used to steady the beating of the human heart. It does this by using a capacitor to send a short, powerful pulse of electrical current through the heart.","The defibrillator contains a capacitor, which in a typical defibrillator is charged to a potential difference of 2,500\u00a0V.","The paddles are placed on the patient\u2019s chest and the capacitor is discharged in a few thousandths of a second. The human heart is a muscle that relies on electric current to make it contract. The defibrillator current runs through the patient\u2019s heart in an effort to restore its regular rhythm.
