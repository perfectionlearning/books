There is a similar law for rotational motion, relating net torque and angular acceleration. ","The rope and pulley we show in the diagram is used to explain this relationship.  The rope applies a torque to the pulley, causing its rotational velocity to increase. We want to know how fast the pulley\u2019s rotational velocity will change as the torque is applied.  In other words, we wish to calculate the pulley\u2019s angular acceleration.","A property called the moment of inertia provides the relationship between net torque and angular acceleration, just as mass provides the relationship between net force and linear acceleration in Newton\u2019s second law. The pulley has a moment of inertia, and we will soon learn how to calculate it. ","As the equation shows, the net torque equals the moment of inertia times the angular acceleration. This is similar to Newton\u2019s second law: Net force equals mass times acceleration."],"objNames":["wb_torque_law_concepts1","wb_torque_law_concepts"]}
