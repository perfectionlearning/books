Materials with high thermal conductivity, such as metals, conduct heat quickly. ","The amount of area of the material exposed to the different temperatures is another factor. The larger the area, the faster the rate of heat transfer.","The temperature difference between the hot and cold sides of the material is a third factor. Heat flows faster when the temperature difference is greater.","The final factor is the thickness of the material. The thicker the material, the more slowly heat passes from one side to the other."],"objNames":["wb_calculate_conduction_concepts"]}
