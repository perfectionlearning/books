","A simple pendulum is an “ideal” pendulum, in that we can simplify how we consider it. It consists of a mass at the end of a light rod, similar to the pendulum in this grandfather clock. When analyzing the motion of the pendulum, all the mass is considered to be concentrated at a point at the rod’s end.","With small amplitudes, the pendulum’s motion closely approximates simple harmonic motion. The smaller the amplitude, the closer the approximation.","The period of the pendulum increases with the length of the pendulum, and decreases with the freefall acceleration. The period of the pendulum is independent of the mass. "],"objNames":["wb_simple_pendulum","wb_simple_pendulum_equation"]}
