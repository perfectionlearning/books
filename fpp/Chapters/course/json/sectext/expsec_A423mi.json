Scientists understood that the Universe should be expanding at a slower rate over time.  The slowing had not been observed, but, theoretically, the expansion should be slowing due to the attractive force of gravity.  Then in 1998, the Hubble Space Telescope observations showed that, a long time ago, the Universe was expanding more slowly than it is today. In other words, the rate of expansion has been <b>increasing<\/b>, rather than decreasing. No one expected or could explain these observations.","The answer scientists came up with is called \u201cdark energy.\u201d  Dark energy would repel itself and cause the observed acceleration in the expansion rate of the Universe.  ","Dark energy must make up about 74% of the Universe to explain its accelerating expansion.  If you do the math, you realize that only about 4% of the Universe is made up of the matter and energy that we do, in fact, understand. ","Unlike dark matter, which can be concentrated and cause gravitational effects in specific locations, dark energy is thought to be spread evenly across the Universe. ","Like dark matter, dark energy fundamentally remains a mystery.  Most scientists are convinced it exists, but cannot say much more about it than that."],"objNames":["wb_dark_energy"]}
