In this example, the force applied is trying to slow the moving ball.  The force is to the left, and the ball\u2019s displacement is to the right. In this case, the angle between the force and displacement vectors is 180\u00b0.","The cosine of 180 degrees is <span class=\"math\">\u22121.<\/span> Whatever the magnitudes of force and displacement, the cosine factor makes the sign of the work negative.
