That is what the pulley shown in the upper diagram does \u2212 a downward pull on the chain lifts up the bucket.","A machine can also change the amount of force or torque. Having more than one pulley means that a person pulling on a rope causes a greater force to be applied to lift the load, though for a shorter distance.  In a similar way, a lever can increase the applied force, at the cost of a smaller displacement. ","We show the six types of simple machines: pulley, lever, inclined plane, wedge, screw and wheel\/axle.  They form the basis for more complicated machines, called \u201ccompound machines.\u201d "],"objNames":["wb_machine_concept1","wb_machine_concept2"]}
