","Thermodynamics focuses on types of energy <b>within<\/b> an object.  Molecules in a fluid or solid interact with one another, and the strength of the interaction depends on the distance between the molecules.  This means they have potential energy.  ","The molecules also can have kinetic energy, as they rotate, translate, or vibrate.  Translation means motion that involves movement from one point to another, such as translating from Earth to Pluto. Molecules translate in fluids. For instance, the molecules in a gas fly around a container at hundreds of kilometers per hour. ","Even with the more fixed structure of a solid \u2212 say a brick that is part of a building \u2212 the molecules that make it up are vibrating and rotating. One model for the vibration motion of molecules in a solid is a spring: the molecules move back and forth as though they are masses connected by springs, possessing both kinetic and potential energy.   ","To give you a sense of thermal energy quantities, the amount of thermal energy required to warm one kilogram of ice from its coldest possible temperature and then melt it is roughly equivalent to the amount of energy that a kilogram would have if it were moving about <span class=\"math\">1,350 m\/s<\/span>, which is about <span class=\"math\">4,860 km\/h<\/span>.
