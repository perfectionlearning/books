A diver, and his equipment, are often less dense than water.  The rubber wetsuit he wears to stay warm also reduces his average density.  To sink, he puts on a weight belt, made of a dense metal. This gives a diver a net force down, and he sinks.","A diver does not want to continue sinking, but wants to have no net vertical force acting on him when he reaches his desired depth.  He could simply drop weights off his belt, but then he would always be buying new weights.","Instead, a diver may have an inflatable vest that expands when filled with air from a cartridge.  This reduces his average density and lets him have the same density as water.  With the inflatable vest, he can also address changes in his density, such as pressure compressing his wetsuit, which increases his average density."],"objNames":["wb_scuba_diver"]}
