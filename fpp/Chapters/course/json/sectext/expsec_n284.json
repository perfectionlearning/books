","The sound waves are longitudinal waves, and they are reflected, at least partially, near the ends of the pipe. A wave reflecting off an opening may not seem logical, but consider the nature of sound waves: They are alternating regions of higher and lower pressure. The region outside a pipe remains at a constant atmospheric pressure, acting like a wall to the wave. ","The reflected sound waves create a standing wave, just as on a string. We show the outlines of the standing wave, representing the maximum displacement of the air particles. ","The areas of maximum displacement are also the areas of minimum pressure change, or pressure nodes.  The pressure nodes at the two ends let us use the same equation to model the harmonics as the equation for a string with two fixed ends.","The same equation that is used for a string with two fixed ends can be used for a wind instrument with two open ends.  The fundamental frequency of a pipe open at both ends equals the wave speed divided by twice the length of the pipe.  Just as in the earlier case of a string with two fixed ends, every integer multiple of the fundamental frequency is a possible harmonic."],"objNames":["wb_wind_instruments_concepts1","wb_wind_instruments_concepts1a"]}
