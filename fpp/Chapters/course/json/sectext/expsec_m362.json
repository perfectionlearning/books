Like the period, it too measures how rapidly cycles are occurring in SHM or waves. ","The frequency is the number of cycles per second that an object completes. ","The unit for frequency is the hertz. The graph shows a frequency of 0.5 hertz, since the object completes half a cycle in a second. Hertz is abbreviated Hz.","The frequency is the reciprocal of the period.  The period is the time it takes to complete a cycle, and the frequency is the number of cycles per second."],"objNames":["wb_frequency_concept","wb_frequency_equation"]}
