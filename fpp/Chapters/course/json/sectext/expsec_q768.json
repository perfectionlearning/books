","We show a current-carrying loop of wire placed in a magnetic field and its pivot rod. The vectors represent the forces acting on the left and right wire segments: These two forces generate a torque that causes the loop to rotate clockwise. ","In the lower diagram we show the current loop end-on, along the pivot rod. The loop rotates around this pivot axis, which you see as a dot in the center. The force vectors show the forces on the left and right sides of the loop. The red dot on the left is the current flowing toward you, and the small red X on the right is the current moving away.  This diagram also confirms that the two forces combine to form a torque that causes the loop to rotate. "],"objNames":["wb_torque_loop_concepts1","wb_torque_loop_concepts2"]}
