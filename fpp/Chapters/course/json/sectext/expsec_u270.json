Differing wavelengths of light are refracted at different angles as they enter the drop. Violet, the shortest wavelength, refracts the most.  ","Light of all wavelengths reflects internally on the far inside surface of the drop and moves toward the left. The light refracts again as it leaves the drop, with the shorter wavelengths again being refracted the most. ","To explain how this dispersion is perceived as a rainbow, we use an observer facing the rainbow. This is shown in the lower diagram. ","The wavelength of the light he sees depends on the raindropâ€™s location. The red light reflected back from the uppermost portions of the rainbow reaches him, but the violet light from those raindrops passes by him. This means he sees a rainbow with red at its top.  ","On the other hand, the violet light reflected back from the lower portions reaches him, but not the red light. This means that he sees a rainbow with violet on the bottom.  The other colors can be explained in the same fashion since their wavelengths lie between the wavelengths of the colors discussed above."],"objNames":["wb_rainbow_concepts1","wb_rainbow_concepts2"]}
