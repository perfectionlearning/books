","The entropy of an isolated system can remain constant or increase. It cannot decrease. An isolated system experiences no heat, work, or matter transfer with its environment.","There is no way for such a system to have its entropy decrease, without \u201chelp\u201d in the form of energy or work from the outside.","Since the universe is an isolated system, the total entropy of the universe is increasing.  Your room, and the rest of the universe, are all getting messier.","The equation with admirable brevity tells us that the change in entropy of an isolated system is always positive or zero.  In other words, entropy is either constant, or it increases."],"objNames":["wb_second_law_entropy_concepts","wb_entropy_increases_equation"]}
