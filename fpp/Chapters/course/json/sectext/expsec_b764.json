A ball being tossed up in the air has a different velocity than one falling down at the same speed. ","We again use a vector arrow to indicate direction.  The arrow points in the direction of the velocity. Its length is proportional to its magnitude.","Mathematical sign is used to indicate the velocity\u2019s direction along a line.  If the car moves to the left its velocity is negative.  If it is stationary (not moving), then its velocity is zero.","If it moves to the right, its velocity is positive.  The velocity gauges in the simulations can show positive and negative values.   ","The equation for velocity is the same as its definition: displacement, the change in position, divided by elapsed time.  The equation provides another way to know that velocity can be negative.  Since displacement can be negative, so too can velocity.       "],"objNames":["actwb_velocity_definition","wb_velocity_equation"]}
