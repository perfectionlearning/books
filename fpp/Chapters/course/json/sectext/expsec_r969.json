In earlier sections, as we hope you recall, we used monochromatic light to generate the band pattern. ","White light is composed of <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_electromagnetic_spectrum3'>visible light<\/a> of all wavelengths. When white light passes through a double-slit barrier, it creates the rainbow-like pattern you see in the upper illustration.","To explain the pattern, we simplify things by using only red and blue light in our analysis. These colors are roughly the longest and shortest of the wavelengths that make up white light. The positions of the bands produced by <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_interference_concepts1'>wave interference<\/a> depend on the wavelength. As you can see in the upper pattern in the second diagram, the first bright band for a long wavelength such as red will be farther from the central maximum than the first bright band for a shorter wavelength such as blue, and the same holds true when comparing the other bright bands.  The pattern for blue light is shown at the bottom of the diagram.","When white light passes through the slits, the staggered bands due to its various colors combine as shown in the middle pattern. The result is a rainbowlike separation of colors. "],"objNames":["wb_double_slit_white_concepts","wb_double_slit_white_concepts2"]}
