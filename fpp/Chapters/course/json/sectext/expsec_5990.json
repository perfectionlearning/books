You see this in the diagram with the velocity arrow longer where the passage is narrower.","We show a fluid flowing through a pipe, speeding up as the pipe narrows.  We can describe the volume flow rate with an equation stating that the volume divided by the time interval is always equal.","Instead of concentrating on the volume per unit time, it may be easier to consider the velocity and the cross-sectional area of the liquid passing by. The volume flow rate equals the product of velocity and the area perpendicular to the velocity.","Since the volume rate is constant, we can write that the product of the velocity and the area is the same at all points along the flow.  To put it another way, the velocity and area at a point are inversely proportional."],"objNames":["wb_fluid_continuity_concepts3","wb_fluid_continuity_equation"]}
