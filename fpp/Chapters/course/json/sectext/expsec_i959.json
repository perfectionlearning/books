","Angular velocity is angular displacement divided by elapsed time. We show a ball moving in the first diagram. Its angular velocity is its angular displacement divided by the time elapsed during that displacement.","The Greek letter <i>Ï‰</i> (omega) represents angular velocity. This equation is used to calculate a constant or average angular velocity.  If the time interval is very small, then the equation is used to calculate instantaneous angular velocity.
