When the sound source moves toward the listener, you can apply the first equation we show to find the sound frequency heard by the listener. Since the denominator will be less than one, the fraction is greater than one, and the listener hears a frequency that is higher than the source frequency.  ","If the sound source moves away from the listener, then you use addition instead of subtraction in the denominator of the fraction. This makes the denominator greater than one, and the fraction less than one. The listener hears a frequency that is lower than that of the source."],"objNames":["wb_doppler_equation1","wb_doppler_equation2"]}
