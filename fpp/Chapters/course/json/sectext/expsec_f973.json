    "When someone pulls on the string of the bow, they are doing work.  They are applying a <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_work_concept'>force through a displacement</a>.    ",
    "When work is done on an object, its energy changes.  The work on the bow increases its elastic potential energy.  ",
    "When the person releases the string, the bow does positive work on the arrow.  The arrow now moves, and its kinetic energy increases.  If the arrow were aimed up at the sky, the work done by the bow would change both the arrow’s kinetic and potential energies.  ",
    "The bow would change both the arrow’s speed (and its kinetic energy) and its height above Earth (affecting its gravitational potential energy).  ",
    "In general, work changes the energy of a system.  Here, we focus on forms of mechanical energy: elastic and gravitational potential energy, and kinetic energy.  The work done on the system equals its change in energy. "
