Values on the vertical axis represent an object’s position, and time is plotted on the horizontal axis.","You can see from the graph that the mouse car started at position <span class=\"math\"><i>x</i> = −4 </span>meters. At two seconds, it is at position <b>A</b>, which is −2 meters. It then moved to the position <span class=\"math\"><i>x</i> = +4 </span>meters at about 4.5 seconds, and stayed there for a couple of seconds.  At 9 seconds, its position is 0. It then reached the position <span class=\"math\"><i>x</i> = −2 </span>meters again after a total of 12 seconds of motion. ","Where the graph is horizontal, as at point <b>B</b>, it means the mouse’s position is not changing: The mouse is <b>not</b> moving.  The red horizontal segment indicates the <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_math_rate_aquarium2'>slope</a> at this point.  ","Where the graph is steep, position is changing rapidly with respect to time, and the mouse is moving quickly. For instance, at points <b>A</b> and <b>C</b> the mouse is moving relatively rapidly."],"objNames":["wb_math_position_time_concept","wb_math_position_time_concept1"]}
