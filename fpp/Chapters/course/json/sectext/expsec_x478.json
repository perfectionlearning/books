We start our discussion of lasers by describing the fundamental properties of the light they produce.","Laser light is coherent. You can see that all the waves are in phase <span class=\"Symbols\">\u2212<\/span> the peaks and troughs are synchronized.","The light of a laser is all one color, such as red. Laser light has a specific wavelength and frequency.","Laser light does not spread out like light from a flashlight. It is highly directional.","Lasers consist of three essential parts. First is the laser medium. Helium-neon gas is a common medium. The medium is energized, after which it can emit light. ","The second essential part of a laser is an energy source, also known as the pump, that adds energy to the medium. This can be done in a variety of ways, such as by discharging electricity through it. This is called the \u201cpumping process.\u201d ","With the laser medium excited, it emits light, which passes back and forth between the container\u2019s mirrored end-walls. During each pass, the light stimulates the medium to emit more photons, which are focused and concentrated by the mirrors. This feedback mechanism forms an optical resonator and is the third essential component of a laser. This results in an amplification of the light."],"objNames":["wb_laser1a","wb_laser2"]}
