That rate equals the slope of a position-time graph. Why? Slope is rise over run. The rise in a position-time graph is the change in position, which is displacement. ","In the example in this section with a vertical theme-park ride, the change in position is the change in height. The run is elapsed time.  The rise over run is the displacement divided by the elapsed time, which is the definition of velocity."],"objNames":["wb_math_position_time_velocity"]}
