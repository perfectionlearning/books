The picture shows what a nearsighted person sees at a distance.","An eye focuses a distant object by allowing the lens to be as flat as possible. In an eye that does not require glasses the image forms on the retina. In a nearsighted eye, the image forms in front of the retina, even when the lens is fully relaxed.
