[OBJ:expsec_t565:Convex mirrors] curve away from the object. [OBJ:expsec_t565:Concave mirrors] curve toward the object.<br />2. In [OBJ:expsec_t568:concave ray diagrams], draw the first ray parallel to the principal axis and reflected back through the focal point. Draw the second ray through the focal point and reflected parallel to the principal axis. Draw the third ray through the center of curvature and reflected back through the center of curvature. Extend all reflected rays behind the mirror as virtual rays. <br />3. In [OBJ:expsec_t570:convex ray diagrams], draw the first ray parallel to the principal axis, and reflected off the mirror so the virtual ray extends back to the focal point. Draw the second ray in the direction of the focal point and then reflected so it is parallel to the principal axis. Draw the third ray toward the center of curvature and reflected so the virtual ray is extended to the center of curvature. <br />4. [OBJ:expsec_t571:Real spherical mirrors] do not create a perfectly focused image. Reflected rays intersect before the focal point. <br />5. [OBJ:pwsec_t572:Parabolic mirrors] do not create spherical aberrations.<br />6. [OBJ:expsec_u282:Reflecting telescopes] are an application of parabolic mirrors.","  <b>Vocabulary:</b>  [OBJ:expsec_t565:concave mirror], [OBJ:expsec_t565:convex mirror], [OBJ:expsec_t566:center of curvature], [OBJ:expsec_t566:principal axis], [OBJ:expsec_t567:focal point], [OBJ:expsec_t567:focal length], [OBJ:expsec_t571:spherical mirror aberration], [OBJ:expsec_u282:reflecting telescope]"],"objNames":["wb_concave_mirror_redux_concepts2","wb_convex_mirror_concepts2"]}
