For example, a scale may report your weight as 135 pounds. That is the gravitational force with which the Earth pulls on you.  ","Weight equals the product of mass and the acceleration due to gravity, or <i>g<\/i>.  The acceleration due to gravity differs on each planet.  A planet or other body always pulls an object down, toward its center, as is reflected in the force vector we show in the diagram. "],"objNames":["wb_weight_definition","wb_weight_equation"]}
