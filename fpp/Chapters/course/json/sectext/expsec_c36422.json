    "Standard deviation is a measure of how spread out or concentrated data is.  The greater the standard deviation, the more spread out the data.  It can provide a measure of the effects of error or uncertainty on the data. ",
    "In the example shown in the first diagram, the charts show that the annual temperature varies more in Taipei than it does in Rio.",
    "The equation is used to calculate standard deviation.  We show it with only three terms, but three would be a small number of data points to estimate a standard deviation.  Six or more data points would be more typical. "
