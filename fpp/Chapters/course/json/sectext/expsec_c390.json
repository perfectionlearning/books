","We show the equation for adding velocities to determine the relative velocity of an object.  Sarah (observer A) measures the velocity of an object, which is itself moving in a reference frame that Sarah perceives as moving. An example is the ball moving on a train that is passing by. ","We calculate the velocity of the ball as measured by observer A by summing two velocities. The first velocity we use is the object\u2019s velocity as measured by someone in reference frame B, the train.
