","An f-stop is the ratio of the lens\u2019s focal length to the diameter of the lens.   ","The standard f-stop numbers are 1.4, 2.0, 2.8, 4.0, and so on.  A smaller number indicates that the lens opening is relatively large compared to the distance to the lens\u2019s focal point and admits more light.  Light intensity diminishes with distance.","If the opening is relatively large and close to the camera sensor, then more light reaches the sensor than if the opening is small or the sensor is relatively far away.  ","The ratio provides a way that is independent of a lens\u2019s focal length to indicate how much light will reach a camera\u2019s sensor.  For instance, the amount of light supplied by lenses with focal lengths of 50 and 200 millimeters can be compared by contrasting their f-stops. "],"objNames":["wb_f_stops1"]}
