When 10 seconds have passed, there are 20 gallons in the tank. ,After 15 seconds, there are 30 gallons in the tank, which is what we expect: 2 gallons per second for 15 seconds results in 30 gallons. The line shows the amount of water in the tank at any time.,We confirm that the slope of the line equals the rate of water flowing into the aquarium. The slope is the rise, the change in the amount of water between two points in time, divided by the run, the elapsed time between those two points.,We calculate the rise between two points. It is 30 gallons minus 10 gallons. The run, the elapsed time, between those two points is 15 seconds minus 5 seconds. After completing some subtraction and division, we confirm that the slope is the rate, 2 gallons per second."

			"text": " In Skee-Ball, you roll a ball on a ramp, trying to cause it to drop into a particular slot in order to score the highest number of points. The ramp is often tilted, so the ball changes speed as it rolls. Although the rules of the game are straightforward, mastering it requires an understanding of the bedrock concepts of linear motion: displacement, velocity and acceleration.  Step right up to the Skee-Ball arcade in this lab and develop your skill! Along the way you can collaborate with your classmates to try to gain the highest total score.  This lab covers the following concepts: Position Displacement Velocity Acceleration Some linear motion equations   Exercise 1: Intro to Skee-Ball  Our Skee-Ball game is a bit different than the one you may have played at your local fairground or amusement park. It is a game of timing and intellectual skill, not physical coordination. Throughout this lab, you will be able to shoot a ball on a ramp straight toward a series of circular slots, as shown in the picture below.  Exercise 1. Shoot ball with correct speed to drop into 50-point slot at 2.00 seconds. In our game, the slots are initially closed. The ball will roll right over the top of them until a stated time when they will all open, allowing the ball to tumble down into one of them. In the first game, the slots will pop open 2.00 seconds after you shoot the ball. As you can see, the slots have scores of 10, 20, 30 and 50. There is also a scale that tells you the positions of the slots in meters (m). The ball is initially at the zero meter position. If your ball is not positioned over any slot when they open, it will roll into the gutter and you will score negative 10 points. You supply the ball with an initial velocity. There is no friction in the game. However, the ramp might be tilted, which could change the ball's velocity. Each game consists of five shots. A scoreboard tallies your progress and displays the number of shots remaining. Give it a try in the first simulation. When you open it, using the link below, you will see a Skee-Ball ramp. There is nothing to calculate here. Just play the game using trial and error. However, we will ask you a question at the end of this section about what you observed. Your ball is next to a plunger that you use to set the ball's initial firing velocity. Use your mouse to click anywhere on this device and pull it back. The farther you pull, the greater the initial velocity the plunger supplies. The velocity in meters per second (m/s) you choose is displayed next to the plunger. Pressing the button marked FIRE will send your ball along the ramp at the initial velocity you have chosen. You can also pause the simulation with the PAUSE button and start a new game with the NEW GAME button. You can even shoot the Skee-Ball in the other direction, to the left, by dragging the plunger to the other side of the ball so that it points in the other direction. This will cause the ball to start with a negative velocity. The negative sign indicates the direction is toward the left. (This technique is necessary in some later exercises.) Use trial and error as you would in a real arcade Skee-Ball game to get a feel for the course and to try to sink the ball in the 50-point slot. Observe the ball's motion after you fire it. Is it moving at a constant speed? Does it ever change direction? If you are not sure, assign the ball a small initial velocity and observe closely. If the ramp is tilted, the force of gravity will accelerate the ball, changing its speed, after you press FIRE. When you are done playing, return here to answer a follow-up question. Click here to enter the Exercise 1 Simulation  1. After you fired the ball, did the ball's speed or direction change?      Exercise 2: Velocity This exercise features a different ramp than Exercise 1. You can get a good score using trial and error, but physics can help you master this game. Two key physics concepts you will need to apply are velocity and acceleration. In this exercise, we will explain velocity first, and then start to explain acceleration. Velocity states the speed and direction of the ball. The speedometer in a car tells you the car’s speed, but not its velocity, since it does not state direction. Sixty km/hr states a speed; 60 km/hr due east states a velocity. Below is the equation for average velocity. Average velocity is defined as the change in position (Δx) divided by the elapsed time (Δt). In equation form, the average velocity of an object between two position points 1 and 2 is:   x1 = position 1 x2 = position 2 t1 = time at position 1 t2 = time at position 2   The change in position, Δx, is the displacement. Displacement states both distance and direction. If the ball moves from a position of 1.0 meter to 3.0 meters along the x axis, the displacement is 3.0 m − 1.0 m, which equals 2.0 meters. When the ball moves to the left, its displacement is negative, since its final position is less than its initial position. The sign of displacement indicates its direction. The timer in the game tells you how much time has passed since the ball was fired. The elapsed time, Δt, is how much time passes as the ball moves from an initial to final position. If you measure the displacement of the ball as it moves from t = 1.00 s to t = 3.00 s, then the elapsed time is 3.00 s − 1.00 s = 2.00 s. As stated, average velocity is the displacement divided by the elapsed time. Example: Suppose the ball moves from 0.50 m to 2.00 m, during which time the clock ticks from 1.00 s to 3.00 s. The ball’s displacement then is 1.50 m, the elapsed time is 2.00 s, and the average velocity is 1.50 m / 2.00 s = 0.75 meters per second (m/s). In this game, we use positive numbers to indicate the ball is moving to the right, and negative numbers to indicate it is moving to the left. A ball that is moving at 3 m/s is moving at the same speed, but opposite direction, of a ball that is moving at −3 m/s. One is moving to the right, and the other to the left. If a ball moves from the position 3.0 m to 1.0 m in two seconds, its displacement is −2.0 m, and its average velocity is −1.0 m/s. The average velocity has the same direction (and sign) as the displacement. In this simulation you will see a gauge below the plunger that displays the ball’s position as it moves along the ramp. You will also see a timer in the scoreboard that starts when you press FIRE. Using the position meter and the timer, you can determine the ball’s average velocity between any two points. Acceleration is the rate of change of the ball’s velocity. It is the change in velocity divided by the elapsed time. Your first challenge in this exercise is to determine at what rate the ball’s velocity changes as it moves along the ramp. In other words, you determine the ball’s acceleration. The acceleration may be zero, which means the velocity does not change. In a follow-up exercise, you will use your findings to calculate the initial velocity that will sink a ball precisely in the 50-point slot. If the ball is not accelerating (its velocity is constant) then choosing an initial velocity for the ball is simpler. If the ball is accelerating (its velocity is changing) then it is more difficult to determine the correct initial velocity needed to sink the ball in the 50-point slot. By recording data to determine a ball’s velocity twice as it moves, you can determine whether the ball’s velocity is constant or changing. Once you know whether the velocity is constant or changing, we will help you calculate how to sink the ball automatically into the 50-point slot.   In this first part of the exercise, there is no game and the slots do not open. Your task is to record data to determine the velocity of the ball after it is fired. Then, you will use your conclusions to play the game in the second part of this section. Pick an initial velocity, vi, for the ball. Press FIRE to shoot the ball along the ramp. When the ball is part way along the ramp, press the PAUSE button to freeze the action. Using the position gauge and the timer, record readings for the ball’s position and the time. Press PAUSE a second time to restart the action. After the ball travels farther along the ramp, push PAUSE again to record another set of data points for position and time. Record your data in the table below. Then, determine if the ball’s velocity is constant or changing as it rolls along the ramp. Remember to record your data in the table below, and answer the follow-up questions. Click here to enter the Exercise 2A Simulation  2.  Enter your data and calculations in the table below. Include the ball’s initial velocity, readings for position and time at any point 1, readings for position and time at point 2, and a calculation of average velocity between 1 and 2.   Vix1t1x2t2Vavg(Δx/Δt)   m/s  m  s  m  s  m/s    3. Using the data, compare your ball’s initial velocity, vi, with its velocity between the two later points. Does the velocity change or stay the same?     4.  Based on your findings about the ball’s velocity on this specific ramp, explain how to calculate an initial velocity that will put the ball into the 50-point slot if the slot is a known distance away, x, and will open in a known amount of time, t.   Now try your answer to Question 4 in the second part of the exercise. The next simulation features a Skee-Ball ramp identical to the one you just investigated. The slots will open 2.00 seconds after you press FIRE. The 50-point slot is 3.00 meters away from the ball’s initial position. What initial velocity should you enter so the ball is positioned over the 50-point slot 2.00 seconds after you fire it? You can use the definition of average velocity to calculate your answer. Give it a try in the simulation. If you do not make it, try again. You get five shots. The sooner you calculate the answer, the higher your total score.  When you are done, return here to answer a follow-up question. If you need a hint on how to solve this problem, click here The velocity of the ball on this ramp is constant. You do not have to worry about the ball speeding up or slowing down. Note how far the ball has to travel to reach the 50-point slot. You know you want it to be at the 50-point slot at 2.00 seconds. You can use the fact that vavg = Δx/Δt to solve the problem. The distance to the 50-point slot is 3.00 meters. The slots will open in 2.00 seconds. Dividing displacement by elapsed time will give you the answer for the ball’s velocity. .  function togglePopup(e){ if(!$(e.target).hasClass(\"midpopup\")){ $(\".midpopup\").show().css(\"left\", \"50%\").css(\"transform\", \"translateX(-50%)\").css(\"-webkit-transform\", \"translateX(-50%)\").css(\"-moz-transform\", \"translateX(-50%)\"); $(document).on(\"click\", hidePopup); } return false; } function hidePopup(e){ if(!$(e.target).hasClass(\"midpopup\") && !$(e.target).hasClass(\"popupParent\")){ $(\".midpopup\").hide(); $(document).off(\"click\", hidePopup); } } Click here to open the Exercise 2B Simulation  5.What initial velocity causes the ball to move 3.00 meters in 2.00 seconds?     Exercise 3: Acceleration In Exercise 2, you learned how to determine the ball’s average velocity. In that exercise, the velocity did not change as the ball traveled along the ramp. Another way of saying the velocity is constant is to say that the acceleration of the ball is zero. What if the acceleration is not zero? In that case, the velocity changes over time. In this exercise, you will determine the ball’s acceleration and then use your conclusions to master a different Skee-Ball ramp. In this simulation, you will see a gauge that displays the ball’s instantaneous velocity, its velocity at a moment in time. Instantaneous velocity is calculated in the same fashion as average velocity, but using the displacement that occurs during a very, very small interval of elapsed time. Average acceleration is defined as the change in instantaneous velocity (Δv) divided by the elapsed time (Δt). In equation form, the average acceleration of an object between any two position points 1 and 2 is:   In this lab, the acceleration is always constant on any ramp. It can be positive, negative or zero, but it does not change in a given simulation. (Note: Some simulations have multiple ramps, and the acceleration may vary from ramp to ramp.)  The ball’s instantaneous velocity will change if the ball is accelerating. By noting the ball’s instantaneous velocity and the time twice, you can use the above equation to calculate the ball’s acceleration. Once you determine the ball’s acceleration, we will help you calculate how to sink the ball into the 50-point slot. In this exercise, there is no game and the slots will not open. Your task is to record data to determine the acceleration of the ball. Pick an initial velocity, vi, for the ball. Press FIRE to shoot the ball along the ramp. Then press the PAUSE button to freeze the action. Using the velocity gauge and the timer, record readings for the ball’s instantaneous velocity and the time. Press PAUSE a second time to restart the action. After the ball travels a bit farther along the ramp, push PAUSE again to record a second set of data for velocity and time. Repeat this 2 more times.  Click here to enter the Exercise 3 Simulation  6.When you graphed the ball’s velocity on the vertical axis, against time on the horizontal axis, you saw a linear graph. What is the meaning of the slope?     7.Does your graph indicate that the ball is accelerating? How do you know? If it is accelerating, is the acceleration positive or negative?    8.Does a negative acceleration mean the ball is “slowing down”? Consider the complete motion of the ball, as it moves in both directions. Use the distinction between speed and velocity in your answer. Remember: Speed is “how fast” but does not indicate direction. Speed is always positive. Velocity reflects speed and direction, and direction in this lab is indicated with a positive or negative sign. Consider the speed of the ball when it first starts moving, and when it passes the plunger on its return journey. How do these speeds compare? What about the two velocities?     9.Graph the ball’s velocity on the vertical axis, against time on the horizontal axis, at four different times. You should see a linear graph. What is the meaning of the constant slope?    "

			"text": " Artillery has a proud history. Napoleon and Harry Truman labored in the artillery before going on to lead their countries. Being an officer in the artillery is hard work. Aiming a cannon requires a detailed understanding of projectile motion. In this lab, you will use trigonometry, vectors and fundamental motion equations to aim a cannon. Master these skills and destroy the enemy castle before its cannon destroys yours!  You will learn: The principles of projectile motion How velocity can be analyzed as separate vertical and horizontal components How to determine the range of a projectile   Exercise 1: Tower height Your cannon rests on top of a castle tower, as shown in the picture below.  Exercise 1. Use the cannonball to determine the height of the tower. You would like to know the height of your tower. Your challenge is to use the cannonball and a stopwatch to determine the tower’s height. You can drop the cannonball straight down from the top of the tower. Using a stopwatch, can you think of a brief experiment to determine the height of the tower?  vf = vi + at Δy = vit + ½ at2 vf2 = vi2 + 2aΔy Δy = ½ (vi + vf)t   a = −9.80 m/s2 Δy = vertical displacement vi = initial velocity vf = final velocity t = elapsed time You may need to use one of the equations above, which describe one-dimensional motion with constant acceleration. In applying these equations to this exercise, a is the rate of acceleration due to gravity. It is the constant rate at which objects accelerate near the Earth’s surface. Because the motion is in the vertical direction, we use Δy to represent displacement.  The acceleration a is given as a negative number because we use the convention that downward displacement is negative and upward displacement is positive.  Throughout this lab, the effect of air resistance is ignored.   1.In a sentence or two, describe your proposed experiment for determining the height of the tower.   Try your experiment in the simulation. Once you open the simulation, you can start the action by pressing FIRE. The cannonball will drop straight down. When you press FIRE, the stopwatch will start automatically. The stopwatch will stop automatically when the cannonball hits the ground. Note how long it takes for the cannonball to hit the ground. The simulation also contains gauges that show the cannonball’s velocity and acceleration at every instant. These gauges will be used more in later exercises, and we will explain them in more depth then. For ease in taking data, these gauges also stop automatically when the cannonball hits the ground. You can also pause the simulation at any time by pressing PAUSE.  When you are done, close the simulation and return here to record your answers. Click here to open the Exercise 1 Simulation  2.How long does it take for the cannonball to reach the ground?    3.The acceleration due to gravity is −9.80 m/s2.   What is the height of the tower, in meters?      Exercise 2: Firing a cannon horizontally You can analyze the velocity of the cannonball you dropped in Exercise 1 in terms of its horizontal and vertical components.  The cannon gave the cannonball zero horizontal velocity, which is why the cannonball dropped straight down. The cannonball also had zero initial vertical velocity, but the magnitude of the vertical velocity increased as the ball fell. The cannonball’s acceleration had horizontal and vertical components, too. It had zero horizontal acceleration (which, combined with zero horizontal velocity, explains why the cannon is not yet particularly useful, except for “welcoming” uninvited guests at the front door).  The cannonball did have a vertical acceleration: It accelerated in the negative direction, toward the ground, at a = −9.80 m/s2. The cannonball’s vertical acceleration was constant.  The acceleration and velocity gauges in this lab are divided into vertical and horizontal components to help demonstrate these points. You can observe the vertical and horizontal velocity components as they change, or stay constant, over time.  Now you get to fire a more useful cannon − one that supplies an initial horizontal velocity to the cannonball. Your goal is to hit the haystack at the 50-meter mark, as shown in the picture below.   Exercise 2. Choose the firing velocity to hit the haystack. Firing horizontally means that you set the cannon’s initial horizontal velocity. The cannonball will have zero vertical velocity when it leaves the mouth of the cannon.  Try to hit the haystack. In addition to adjusting the velocity, take note of how long it takes for each cannon shot to hit the ground. Be prepared to answer the two questions below (you may want to look at them before you open the simulation).  You set the horizontal firing velocity of the cannon by dragging the arrow (the vector) that emanates from the cannon’s mouth. You can fine-tune the firing velocity by clicking on the up and down buttons in the control panel.  As before, press the FIRE button to shoot the cannon. You can shoot as many times as you like. Try a range of firing velocities, and for each shot note how long it takes for the ball to hit the ground. Also keep an eye on the vertical velocity and acceleration of your cannon shots. Do they change based on the horizontal velocity?  When you are done, return here to answer the questions below. Click here to enter the Exercise 2 Simulation  4.Does the horizontal firing velocity of the cannon affect how long it takes for each cannon shot to hit the ground? Explain your finding, referring to the component nature of velocity and acceleration.      5.Does the horizontal velocity affect the vertical velocity of the cannonball? The vertical acceleration of the cannonball? Explain.      Exercise 3: Blast away! Test your physics skills by firing against an opponent (such as a classmate), or by taking on the computer. In this section, you must use your physics knowledge to calculate how to hit the opposing targets. As in Exercise 2, your cannon fires horizontally and you control only that velocity component. Your challenge is to calculate which firing velocity will hit the opponents’ targets before the opposing player, or the computer, destroys yours.    Exercise 3. Hit the opposing flag and drop a shot through the castle door. When calculating how to hit a target, it is helpful to think about what information you have at your disposal:  By looking at the distance scale, you know exactly where the targets lie along the x axis from the mouth of your cannon atop the tower. In the diagram above, the blue cannon on the left is trying to hit the red flag located 45 m away. The location of the flag will change when you restart the game. The other goal is to fire a cannonball through the door opening by aiming at the point 105 meters away.   You know how much time it will take any cannonball to hit the ground (by observation from Exercises 1 and 2). The two towers are the same height.   Your challenge is to fire the cannonball with a velocity that will cause it to fly the horizontal displacement to a target in the time that it also drops vertically to the ground.  You know how long it will take the cannonball to reach the ground, and how far away the targets are in the horizontal dimension. If you know displacement and time, can you determine velocity? The answer is yes!  Test yourself in the simulation. You rule the blue-flagged castle and control the cannon on top of it. You can set the horizontal velocity of the cannonball by dragging the head of the vector arrow emanating from the cannon’s mouth, or by clicking the up and down buttons in the control panel.  Either the computer or a classmate will run the cannon on top of the red-flagged castle. Whoever hits all the opposing targets first wins the game. The computer hits a target about two out of three times it fires.  Each side is trying to hit two targets. The positions of these targets on the horizontal axis are marked by the triangle locaters that appear beneath the number line.  If you guess − if you do not use your physics knowledge − you may lose. When you open the simulation, choose either PLAY COMPUTER or PLAY CLASSMATE. You may play as many times as you wish by pressing PLAY AGAIN. If you want to start over, press RESET.  Click here to enter the Exercise 3 Simulation   Exercise 4: Fire straight up  In this exercise, you are starting your next stage of artillery training: shooting with a vertical velocity component. Your castle-top cannon has run out of cannonballs, and a battering ram is advancing to destroy your castle!  Fortunately, you have another cannon on the ground, pointed straight up. If you can fire cannonballs to the top of the tower so that they arrive there with zero velocity, the gunner at the top can catch them and use them to fend off the advancing battering ram.     Exercise 4. Shoot the cannonball so it reaches the tower top with zero velocity.  vf = vi + at Δy = vit + ½ at2 vf2 = vi2 + 2aΔy Δy = ½ (vi + vf)t   a = −9.80 m/s2 Δy = vertical displacement vi = initial velocity vf = final velocity t = elapsed time You determined the tower height in Exercise 1. You can shoot with any vertical velocity you want. The mouth of the cannon is at ground level. What initial velocity must you choose so that the ball arrives at the top of the castle with zero velocity? Again, you may need one or more of the equations on the right. These equations describe one-dimensional motion with constant acceleration.  6.Make a calculation in advance: What initial vertical velocity will propel the cannonball upward so that it arrives with zero velocity at the top of the castle?    Now test your answer in the simulation. You control only the vertical velocity of the cannon. Your challenge is to propel the cannonball so that it reaches the peak of its flight at the same height as the top of the tower. At its peak, the cannonball’s velocity must equal zero for your comrade to be able to catch the cannonball.  Enter an initial vertical velocity, in m/s, by dragging the head of the vector arrow or clicking the up and down buttons in the control panel. Press FIRE to try your shot.  Each time you shoot, the battering ram gets closer to your castle! After you have succeeded, press RESET. Now fire the cannonball at a velocity other than the correct answer, like 20.0 m/s. Record how long it takes for the cannonball to reach the peak of its motion and how long it takes to make the other half of the journey (back to the cannon mouth). It may prove effective to push PAUSE when the velocity equals 0.0 m/s in order to record the time at the peak. If you cannot pause the simulation exactly at a peak, consider recording a few data points and calculating an average percentage for the time spent traveling up, versus time spent traveling down. Even though this is a computerized lab, techniques used in traditional labs apply here. Also record the cannonball’s velocity at the end of its journey (the simulation pauses when the cannonball returns to the cannon).  When you are done, return here to answer a follow-up question. Click here to enter the Exercise 4 Simulation  7.When you fire the cannonball so your colleague does not catch it, what percentage of the time does the cannonball spend going up versus down? What is the relationship of the initial and final velocities of the cannonball?      Exercise 5: The symmetry of a projectile  Up until now, you have fired projectiles with the following characteristics:  Zero initial horizontal velocity and zero initial vertical velocity (Exercise 1).  Positive initial horizontal velocity and zero initial vertical velocity (Exercises 2 and 3).   Zero horizontal velocity and positive initial vertical velocity (Exercise 4).  In this exercise, you get to fire a more flexible cannon − one that supplies the cannonball with initial horizontal and vertical velocity components. You will see a parabolic arc traced out by the cannonball as it flies through the air.   Exercise 5. Use the cannon to explore projectile motion. You control the cannonball's initial horizontal and vertical velocities separately. As before, you also have the velocity and acceleration gauges, a stopwatch, and the PAUSE button (which makes collecting data convenient).  We have placed the cannon at a location such that the cannonball will leave the barrel at ground level. Assume the cannonball begins its trajectory at the 0 point on the x axis. When you swivel the cannon’s barrel there will be slight changes in launch location, but they will not significantly affect the range or flight-time of your cannonball. Enter a value for horizontal velocity and a value for vertical velocity, press FIRE, and observe what happens. Try several velocities to see what happens to the ball throughout its arcing flight across the field. The goal of this exercise is to take some data and analyze the flight of a projectile.  Answer the following questions based on your knowledge of physics. Use the simulation either to confirm your answers when you are done, or to obtain some help.   8.For any projectile that launches and lands at the same height, what percentage of the total flight time passes on the way up and what percentage passes on the way down? Use the PAUSE button and the stopwatch to find out. Explain your answer. (This question and the one that follows resemble those in the prior exercise; the conclusions you reach here are important so we stress this point with a little repetition.)    9.For a given firing of the cannon, how does the initial vertical velocity of the cannonball compare to the vertical velocity immediately before the cannonball hits the ground?     10.For a given firing of the cannon, how does the initial horizontal velocity of the cannonball compare to the horizontal velocity immediately before the cannonball hits the ground?   As before, you can select a firing velocity by dragging the head of the vector arrow that emanates from the cannon’s mouth. In the control panel for this simulation, you will see two firing velocity controls, one for the horizontal component of the cannonball's velocity and the other for the vertical component. Both are in m/s.  As before, you also have a stopwatch and the usual gauges and buttons. Choose a vertical and horizontal velocity and fire the cannonball. The gauges display the final values for velocity and acceleration when the cannonball hits the ground.  To answer the question about the percentage of time spent moving up as opposed to down, use the PAUSE button to freeze the cannonball at various points. You will know the cannonball has reached its peak when its vertical velocity equals 0 m/s; it may be more effective to note the cannonball has reached the peak of its motion by looking at this gauge as opposed to the cannonball itself.   Try several combinations of horizontal and vertical velocities. Then return here and answer the above questions. Click here to enter the Exercise 5 Simulation   Exercise 6: Artillery fire!  It is time to put what you have learned about projectile motion to the test. In this exercise, you will again pit your skills against the computer or a classmate, using your knowledge of projectile motion to calculate how to hit the opposing targets on the first try.    Exercise 6. Choose horizontal and vertical velocity components to hit the targets. The cannonballs exit the cannons at ground level. To strike the enemy targets, you must set the initial horizontal and vertical velocity components for your cannonball.  Think again about what determines the arc of your cannonball, and whether it will hit the target. The vertical velocity component determines how long the cannonball remains in the air (from Exercise 4).  The horizontal velocity component determines the cannonball’s range (from Exercises 2 and 3). You can calculate the combination of vertical and horizontal velocities needed to hit any target. Note: The cannon has a minimum vertical velocity of 35 m/s.  If you have trouble hitting these targets, here is a hint. Pick a reasonable value for the vertical component of velocity (again, the minimum is 35 m/s). You can calculate how long the cannonball will be in the air, and then use that time to determine the required horizontal velocity. There are two ways you can determine this flight time; either by considering the relationship between the initial and final velocities of the cannonball, or by considering the vertical velocity at the peak of the cannonball’s motion, and what percentage of the flight time it spends reaching the peak. Applying either of these concepts, and motion equations that have been shown to you in this lab, you can calculate the flight time.   In this simulation, you again rule the blue-flagged castle and control the cannon on the ground in front of it. You choose a combination of horizontal and vertical velocity components for this cannon. Drag the head of the vector arrow emanating from the cannon around until the values you want appear in the control panel. You can also adjust these values using the buttons in the control panel.  Either the computer or a classmate will control the cannon in front of the red-flagged castle. Whoever hits all the opposing targets first wins the game. If you play the computer, you play against a formidable, but not perfect, competitor.  Each side is trying to hit two targets. One is the base of the opposing flag. The other challenge is to fire the ball through the opening in the door to the opposing castle. The horizontal range required to hit these targets is marked with the triangle locaters beneath them.  When you open the simulation, choose either PLAY COMPUTER or PLAY CLASSMATE. You may play as many times as you wish by pressing PLAY AGAIN. If you want to start over, press RESET.  Click here to enter the Exercise 6 Simulation   Exercise 7: Use trigonometry to destroy the castle! In the earlier exercises, you separately specified two parameters: the horizontal and vertical components of the cannonball’s velocity. It is more common for a cannon to fire a cannonball at a fixed speed, and the artillery officer controls the angle at which it is fired.  Using trigonometry, we can determine the velocity components from the firing speed (the magnitude of the velocity vector) and the angle at which the cannon is fired.  In the picture below, note that the cannons again feature vector arrows that can be used to set the initial velocity. As you rotate the vector, a display reads out the angle above the horizontal. By lengthening or shortening the aiming vector, you can change the firing speed.    Exercise 7. Select a firing angle to hit the opposing targets. Your challenge in this exercise is to enter a speed and firing angle to hit the opposing targets before your opponent hits all of yours.  This is similar to Exercise 6, except now your answers must be expressed in terms of firing speed and angle, rather than velocity components. You can convert between velocity components and speed and angle using the following equations:  vy = v sinθ vx = v cosθ v = firing speed θ = firing angle vx and vx = velocity components  The cannon in this simulation can rotate between 45 degrees and 90 degrees (for the cannon on the left), or 135 degrees to 90 degrees (for the cannon on the right).  This time, each player has a battering ram. Every time a shot misses, the battering rams advance on the opposing castle. This means the battering rams are moving targets; they adjust their position after each miss. If you do not hit your opponent’s battering ram before it reaches your castle − look out!  You rule the blue castle and control the cannon on the ground in front of it. Click on the head of the vector arrow and swivel it around until the value for the angle you want appears in the control panel. Shorten or lengthen the vector to change the firing speed.  Either the computer or a classmate will run the cannon for the red castle. Whoever hits all the opposing targets first wins the game.  Each side is trying to hit two targets: 1) an opening of the front door of the opposing castle, and 2) a battering ram team that advances on its mission of smashing your castle.  Record your answers. Note the target, where it was located, and the firing angle used for your cannon to hit the targets. Record those values in the table below.  When you open the simulation, choose either PLAY COMPUTER or PLAY CLASSMATE. You may play as many times as you wish by pressing PLAY AGAIN. If you get stuck, press RESET.  Click here to enter the Exercise 7 Simulation  11.Record the horizontal distance to each target and the firing angle you used to hit the targets in the box below.   Distance from cannon Firing speed Firing angle  Castle door  m  m/s  °  Battering ram  m  m/s  °      Exercise 8 (optional): Establishing a range equation Determining the correct firing speed and angle to hit a target requires a series of calculations. Is there a general approach (equation) for the case when the projectile begins and ends at the same height?  It would help if you had an equation in which the cannon's range − how far the cannonball travels in the horizontal direction − is calculated from the initial firing speed and the cannon angle. If you knew the distance to the target, you could choose a firing angle and solve for the speed (or vice-versa), then blast away!  But what is the equation? In this exercise, your challenge is to establish a range equation for your cannon. You can fire the cannonball at the small lake 225 meters away.    Exercise 8. Use the cannon to validate a range equation. Here are some hints on how to proceed:  Your goal is to write an equation so that the range, or horizontal distance, is dependent on initial speed and cannon angle. There can be other factors in the equation, but they must not vary with the shot (for instance, mass or a). The equation will be of a form so that range (Δx) is set equal to an expression in which the unknown variables are firing speed and aiming angle.   Remember that range is calculated by knowing the horizontal component of the velocity and the time the cannonball stays in the air.   You do not want time as a variable in this equation. You need to find a way to eliminate the time variable. (Extra hint: What determines the time the cannonball stays in the air? Consider writing a second equation and solving that equation for time. Remember that you do know the acceleration of the cannonball in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions.)   Some of the standard motion equations might help!   You can use the cannon simulation to take data, and to experiment with the relationship between firing speed, cannon angle and range.  As before, you can change the firing speed and angle by clicking on the vector arrow emanating from the cannon and swiveling it around until the desired speed and angle appear in the window.  You also have a stopwatch, gauges and the usual buttons − FIRE, PAUSE and RESET. If you succeed in writing an equation, make sure you use the simulation to test it. Enter some values in your equation and then see if the cannon in the simulation reproduces those results.   If you cannot succeed in deriving this equation during the lab, you might ask your teacher or professor whether you can make it a homework assignment to turn in later. If so, fire the cannon a few times, and record the angle, speed and range. Use this data to confirm your equation.   When you are done, return here to answer some follow-up questions. Click here to enter the Exercise 8 Simulation (optional)  12.Write an equation you could use to calculate projectile range (horizontal distance) for any initial velocity and cannon angle. Since you are using a computer to write an equation, you may need to use words to describe the equation (for example, the range equals the square root of the cosine of the firing angle).     13.Even if you do not succeed in determining the equation, try this additional exercise. Pick a speed and an angle (other than 45°) and determine the range. With the speed constant, can you determine another angle which will result at the same range? Try experimenting until you can do so. How are these two angles related? If you succeeded in deriving the equation, can you briefly explain how the equation confirms that two angles will yield a given range for a particular speed?     "

			"text": " Physicists love juggling. Done correctly, juggling is a beautiful demonstration of projectile motion. This lab covers the physics of juggling. By the end, you will be skilled enough to juggle five chainsaws!  This lab covers the following topics: horizontal and vertical components of velocity projectile motion calculating range and height for projectiles how to juggle five (virtual) chainsaws and amaze your friends   Exercise 1: Juggling one ball Throwing a single ball into the air and catching it may not seem like juggling. But the simple catch and throw is the basis for all juggling. Jugglers must be able to throw a ball to a consistent height and judge precisely when and where it will land. A common way to learn to juggle is to start with one ball, throwing it so that it stays in the air for a consistent amount of time.   Exercise 1. Pick an initial vertical velocity to keep the ball in the air for 1.4 seconds. In the first exercise, your challenge is to determine the initial vertical velocity so that the ball’s time of flight, or hang time, is 1.4 seconds. This time is how long it takes the ball to rise to its peak and fall back to its initial height, where the juggler will catch it. When a ball is thrown upward, the force of gravity causes it to accelerate at a constant rate, slowing the ball as it rises and then speeding it up as it falls. While the ball is in the air, its acceleration is −9.80 m/s2. The magnitude of this acceleration is represented by g; the sign is negative because the acceleration is downward. A ball thrown upward has positive “y“, or vertical, velocity. The ball slows until its velocity is zero at the peak of its motion. After that, the ball continues to accelerate at −9.80 m/s2, which means it then has negative y velocity and is moving downward.  vf = vi + at Δy = vit + ½ at2 vf2 = vi2 + 2aΔy Δy = ½ (vi + vf)t   a = −9.80 m/s2 Δy = vertical displacement vi = initial velocity vf = final velocity t = elapsed time The equations shown in the box above describe this linear freefall motion. Throughout the lab, you may make use of some or all of these motion equations. Because in this lab you will use these equations to determine motion in the vertical direction, we specify the displacement as Δy. The same equations also can be used to describe motion in the horizontal direction. In that case, Δx is substituted for Δy. As stated, the variable a in this lab is the acceleration due to gravity, −9.80 m/s2.  Later, we will introduce the horizontal velocity with which the juggler throws the ball from one hand to the other. For now, the juggler throws a single ball up and back down to the same hand. The effect of air resistance is ignored during this entire lab.  1.Using one or more of the motion equations shown in the box above, calculate the initial vertical velocity needed to throw a ball into the air for a total flight time of 1.4 seconds, assuming the acceleration due to gravity is −9.80 m/s2. Your answer should be accurate to the nearest 0.1 m/s.    Test your answer in the juggling simulation. When you open the simulation, you will see a control panel at the bottom. It contains one input gauge, marked \"Initial y velocity.” This controls the vertical (y) component of the ball's velocity. You should specify a value in the “Initial y velocity” gauge, in meters per second, m/s. (The ball’s x velocity is fixed at 0 m/s, although you will be able to adjust it later in this lab.) Again, your goal is to throw the ball straight up in the air so that its total time of flight − up and then down − is as close as possible to 1.4 seconds. Once you have specified a value for the y velocity, press GO. Is the total flight time 1.4 seconds? The stop watch provided in the control panel runs automatically and will enable you to see if your initial velocity is correct. Don’t worry if you do not get it right the first time. As with real juggling, you can try again. Hit RESET, type in a new value, and press GO. You can try it as many times as you like. When you are done, return here to answer some follow-up questions. Click here to open the Exercise 1 Simulation  2. Does the ball take the same amount of time to rise to its peak as it does to fall from the peak back down? (Use the simulation to find the answer to this question. The PAUSE button will help you.)     3. To get the ball to go straight up and come back down to the same hand, the value for the x velocity must be zero. Why?      Exercise 2: Two balls with one hand Now we add a second ball. Because a hand cannot catch and throw at the same instant, you must stagger the throws and catches. When juggling two balls with one hand, you should throw the second ball approximately when the first ball is at the peak of its flight. Later, when you juggle three balls, we will help you determine the correct timing of the throws. Your challenge in this exercise is to juggle two balls with one hand. As in Exercise 1, you will assign an upward velocity to the balls so each hangs in the air for 1.4 seconds. In this exercise you must also specify a time interval between throws, in seconds. This time is equal to the time it takes for one ball to rise from the juggler’s hand to the peak of its flight.  Firing horizontally means that you set the cannon’s initial horizontal velocity. The cannonball will have zero vertical velocity when it leaves the mouth of the cannon.   4. You want to throw a ball upward so that its hang time − the time it takes to go up and then back down − is 1.4 seconds. How long will it take, in seconds, for the ball to reach its peak?    The time it takes a ball to rise to its peak is the time you should specify in the “Time interval” gauge in the control panel. If you specify the correct time, the juggler will throw the second ball precisely when the first ball is at the peak. You can also check your answer using the stopwatch in the control panel. Changing the interval between tosses affects the spacing between the balls. You can successfully keep the balls in the air with a wide range of interval values, but the juggling will look most polished when you have the right interval.   In the control panel gauge marked \"Initial y velocity,\" specify a value for the vertical component of the ball's velocity that will keep it in the air for a total of 1.4 seconds. This is the same as the value that you used in Exercise 1. In the gauge marked \"Time interval,\" specify a time, in seconds, for a ball with a total hang time of 1.4 seconds to reach its peak. After you press GO, the computer will throw the first ball according to your velocity, then automatically throw the second ball with the same velocity after waiting the period of time you specify. This cycle will repeat until you close the simulation or the juggler drops a ball. It may appear that the balls are overlapping in flight, and perhaps should collide. Assume that when the balls appear to be passing through one another, what is really happening is that one is passing in front of the other. You can try again by hitting RESET and specifying new values in the control panel. When you are done, return here to answer a follow-up question. Click here to open the Exercise 2 Simulation  5. You may have noticed that a ball with a total hang time of 1.4 seconds always rises to the same height above the juggler’s hands. What is that height? (You may need to use one or more of the motion equations in the table in Exercise 1 to answer this question.) You can also check your calculated answer using the simulation.     Exercise 3: Two balls with two hands You are almost a virtual juggler. Now you just have to learn to throw from one hand to the other. In this exercise, you will specify the same two values as in Exercise 2: the vertical, or y, component of velocity and the time interval between throws. You will also determine how to throw the balls horizontally from one hand to the other.   Exercise 3. Give each ball a hang time of 1.4 seconds and hit the other hand 0.70 m away. How can you do this? You know the vertical velocity needed to give each ball a total hang time of 1.4 seconds. The distance between the juggler's hands is 0.70 meters. Knowing this distance, and knowing the time it takes for a ball to travel through its entire arc of motion, you can calculate the x, or horizontal, component of velocity needed to throw the ball from one hand to the other. Unlike the vertical component of velocity, the horizontal component will be constant.   6. Using the above information, calculate the horizontal velocity needed to precisely toss each ball from the juggler's right hand to his left hand (given that the hang time of each ball is 1.4 seconds).     Test your answer. Specify three values in the control panel: an initial y velocity, an initial x velocity, and the time interval between throws. You should use the same time interval here that you calculated in Exercise 2 (the time it takes for a ball to rise to the peak of its arc). Using the values you give, the computer will automatically program the second hand to throw the balls back to the beginning hand. You only have to get it right going from the juggler's right hand to his left hand (from your left to your right). Again, try as many times as you like to get it right. You can press RESET at any time and specify new values. When you are done, return here to answer some follow-up questions. Click here to open the Exercise 3 Simulation  7. Was your predicted value for the initial x velocity correct? If not, try again and write the correct velocity in the box below.    8. Does the fact that a ball has a horizontal velocity affect the initial y velocity or how long the ball is in the air? Use the gauges in the simulation to inform your answer.      Exercise 4: The amazing juggler You are ready to juggle! Juggling three balls is not much different than juggling two. Again, you will specify the initial y velocity, the initial x velocity, and the time delay between throws. As before, you want to throw each ball into the air for 1.4 seconds, during which time each ball will move through a horizontal displacement of 0.70 meters. In juggling three or more objects, there is a formula for calculating the correct time interval between throws so that your virtual juggling looks as polished as the real thing. First, determine the time it takes for a single ball to leave one hand, rise and fall to the other hand, and then rise and fall back to the starting hand (in other words, double the hang time). Second, divide this round trip time by the number of objects being juggled. The result is the desired time interval between throws. Example: Suppose you want to juggle three balls so that each one has a hang time of 2.0 seconds. Each ball would take 4.0 seconds to complete a round trip, a total of 2.0 seconds to go up from the first hand and down to the second, then another 2.0 seconds to make the return trip. The time delay between throws then would be 4.0 seconds divided by 3, which is 1 1/3 seconds. In other words, when juggling three balls, the second ball should be thrown a little after the first ball has passed the peak of its arc. (You will use this formula again later when attempting to juggle five chainsaws!)  Give juggling three balls a try. Each ball should have a hang time of 1.4 seconds. Specify an initial y velocity and an initial x velocity so that each ball travels 0.70 m horizontally during its flight time. Also specify a time interval between throws using the input gauges in the control panel. Then press GO and amaze your friends! The computer will automatically program the second hand, using your specified values, to throw the balls back to the beginning hand. If you get the time interval correct, a ball will be released just when the prior ball is starting to fall toward the other hand. Your juggling will look as smooth and polished as a professional’s. Once you have successfully juggled three balls, try juggling higher or lower by varying the initial y velocity. Here's something to think about: If you increase the initial y velocity, will the initial x velocity required for the juggler to catch the balls with the other hand increase, decrease or stay the same? Why? When you are done, return here to go on to the next exercise. Click here to open the Exercise 4 Simulation  9. If you increase the initial y velocity of the balls (i.e. throw them higher), does the initial x velocity required for the juggler to catch the balls with the other hand increase, decrease or stay the same? Why?      Exercise 5: Juggling to a specific height Now that you know how to juggle you can do all sorts of tricks to wow the crowd. How about juggling the balls through a hoop at a set height above the juggler’s hands? In this exercise, your juggler should throw the balls through the hoop, the center of which is 6.0 meters above his hands. His hands are 1.1 meters apart, as shown in the illustration below.    Exercise 5. Juggle through the center of the hoop 6.0 meters up. Here, the challenge is to juggle consistently to a certain height. Notice that we did not mention the hang time. Starting with the vertical and horizontal displacement, you must determine the initial y velocity, hang time and initial x velocity. Then, you must also determine the time interval between throws, using the technique outlined in the previous exercise.   10. What initial y velocity is needed to throw a ball 6.0 meters vertically into the air, assuming that the acceleration due to gravity is −9.80 m/s2?     11. What is the total hang time − the time going up plus the time falling back down − of a ball thrown to a height of 6.0 meters?    12. What initial x velocity will move the ball through a horizontal displacement of 1.1 m in the time it takes the ball to rise to 6.0 meters and fall back down again?     Use the simulation to test your answers. The usual input gauges are in the control panel, for initial y velocity, initial x velocity, and the time interval between throws. Determine the time interval between throws by doubling the hang time and dividing it by three (the number of balls). You should have calculated the hang time in Question #11 above. Specify your values by clicking the up/down buttons that control the three input gauges in the control panel. Press GO to see if the juggler successfully juggles three balls through the hoop. You can try as many times as you like using the RESET button. Do not get discouraged. If you calculate incorrectly, use the simulation to figure out where you may have gone wrong. You can use the stopwatch in the simulation to check hang times. Redo your calculations as needed and try again. When you are done with the simulation, return here to continue on to the next exercise. Click here to open the Exercise 5 Simulation  7.When you fire the cannonball so your colleague does not catch it, what percentage of the time does the cannonball spend going up versus down? What is the relationship of the initial and final velocities of the cannonball?     "

A reference frame is used to measure motion from an observer’s perspective.2. When one reference frame is moving relative to the other reference frame, each observer in their respective reference frames will observe relative velocities for objects.3. When two objects are moving in an observer’s reference frame, the velocities of both objects can be calculated relative to each other.,  In-class assessment:1. Calculate relative velocities.,  Quick Review:  Reference Frame, Relative Velocity"
