The simulation will let you know if you are correct. You may decide to keep the cuddly creatures, but you want to be fairly charged.,Each rabbit in the simulation has a velocity gauge that you can use to monitor its motion. The simplest way to solve this problem is to consider the rabbits one at a time: look at a rabbit’s velocity gauge and determine if the velocity is changing at a constant rate.

In this section, we discuss the relationship between the water flow rate and the slope of the volume versus time graph.,The vertical axis of the graph is the amount of water in gallons, and the horizontal is time in seconds. We plot the point (0, 0), since at 0 seconds, there are 0 gallons of water in the aquarium.,As mentioned, the water flows at 2 gallons per second. At 5 seconds, there are 10 gallons of water in the tank. When 10 seconds have passed, there are 20 gallons in the tank. ,After 15 seconds, there are 30 gallons in the tank, which is what we expect: 2 gallons per second for 15 seconds results in 30 gallons. The line shows the amount of water in the tank at any time.,We confirm that the slope of the line equals the rate of water flowing into the aquarium. The slope is the rise, the change in the amount of water between two points in time, divided by the run, the elapsed time between those two points.,We calculate the rise between two points. It is 30 gallons minus 10 gallons. The run, the elapsed time, between those two points is 15 seconds minus 5 seconds.

For instance, a kilogram is 1,000 grams, and a centimeter is one-hundredth of a meter. ,You may see some SI units mentioned. That is an abbreviation for the System International for Units.  It includes the metric system. Scientists update the SI units to current technological standards. ,There are seven base units: the meter, second, kilogram, ampere, kelvin, candela, and mole.

These explanations are called hypotheses and theories. Scientists create hypotheses, ways to explain what scientists observe and to predict future observations. For a hypothesis to be accepted as true and to become a well-accepted theory, scientists must be able to test it. ,Science generates predictions of future behavior. It predicts what scientists will observe. For instance, Albert Einstein’s theory of special relativity predicted that time should pass more slowly for a fast-moving object than for a stationary observer. It took decades before technology developed enough to test his hypotheses. ,As scientists do their work, they generate knowledge about the world we live in.

Einstein’s work was crucial to developing other theories as new areas of science developed − in this case, the relationship of light and gravity.  His theory predicted that gravity should bend light by an amount twice as great as that predicted by older theories.  That seemed hard to test (since the amount of gravity had to be great).  ,Scientists realized that they could use the natural phenomenon of a solar eclipse to observe starlight passing near the Sun’s surface.  Not only could they see if light was bent, but they could also test if the theory of general relativity correctly predicted how much it was bent.  When they made their observations, they found that Einstein’s theory correctly predicted the bending of the light.  ,Einstein’s theory relied on earlier science. For instance, he and others knew what was meant by “gravity” as it was developed by Sir Isaac Newton.

Then, you might change the mass of one ball, and then the velocity, each time conducting the same experiment three times. ,Part of making observations is planning for <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_precision_accuracy_concepts'>precision</a> and <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_precision_accuracy_concepts1a'>accuracy</a>. These will have effects on the uncertainty (error) in your results. This can be part of a presentation of quantitative results.  What are the most precise measurements you can make?  Are you using the most precise equipment the lab offers?  And how can you increase accuracy?  For instance, is the equipment calibrated (compared to known standards)?  Are you taking advantage of the most recent appropriate technology available to you?  "

Take advantage of recycling bins and other processes that your school uses for recycling.  If material cannot be recycled, then you may have to dispose of it.,Equipment you use should be disposed of properly to ensure safety and for environmental concerns.  This includes everything from simpler components such as batteries to complex items such as laptops.  ,Equipment is often labeled for safe disposal, which may include delivering it to a facility providing disposal services.  The codes for disposal are often stamped on the equipment. Materials that cannot simply be thrown away or easily recycled are often stamped with markings such as the one shown in the photograph. Some cities and other governmental entities as well as stores offer free disposal of equipment such as laptops. ,As always, if you are not sure: Ask!  Instructors should know safe disposal procedures, and your fellow students may be aware of recycling options. Perhaps demonstrating an understanding of the proper disposal or recycling of materials can become part of your lab reports."

This unit uses several case studies of news and marketing claims, and asks you to evaluate the claims.  ,To judge a marketing claim, we start with the source.  We prefer an unbiased and respected source.  By biased, we mean: Is the claim being made by someone who benefits, financially or otherwise, whether it is true or false?  ,We want to read the claim carefully to make sure we understand precisely what is being said.  Then we want to decide: How relevant is it?  Advertisements may be about a broad topic, such as “sleeping better at night,” but the claim itself may be very specific, such as: “You will fall asleep 15 minutes sooner on average.”  In short, we would prefer a testable hypothesis.,Data is used to test whether a hypothesis is true or false, and that is how any marketing claim should be judged. What data is being supplied to support the claim?  A strong claim will be backed by data available to others, and we would want independent researchers to confirm it.  Experiments will be conducted by people not directly linked to the company making the claim.  We want to use empirical evidence to test a scientific explanation. “Empirical” means based on observation and experiments.,Lastly: When was the claim made?  Have others had time to review it?

It disagreed enough to sue the first company for making false claims.  The company that brought the suit said its golf balls went just as straight.,What evidence was being used? The two companies used very different arguments to claim their golf balls went straighter.  One used the design of the ball, saying its design proved its ball would travel straighter.  The other company had done tests with its golf ball and others, using a machine to putt them and recording the results. ,In addition to analyzing their evidence, you could conduct your own experiments inside or outside the classroom.

The system is used to determine your position on the surface of the Earth.  Today, everything from cellphones to cameras and watches contain GPS technology.,A GPS receiver works by noting its position relative to satellites that send out radio signals. The diagram gives you a sense of how it receives signals from multiple satellites (there are 24 satellites altogether).  The satellites send signals with the exact time and their own location. The GPS chip notes the differences in the arrival times of the radio signals.  Using the basic formula that distance equals the product of speed and elapsed time, it establishes its distance from the various satellites, and uses geometry to determine its own location.,GPS manufacturers market how accurate their system is.    Many mention the system of 24 satellites that send signals.  Some manufacturers claim accuracy within a few meters. ,Another service has sprung up that does not rely on satellites, but, rather, on the location of cell phone towers.  The software running in a cell phone notes the relative signal strength from nearby cell phone towers, and determines its position based on the location of those towers.

Scientific journals are required reading for scientists.  The story we analyze was about the number of stars in the universe.  A newspaper story in late 2010 said that scientists think there are three times as many stars as previously was thought.  That sounds dramatic:   Scientists off by a factor of two or three?  Had not scientists been looking at stars for a while? We use an approach similar to the approach we used with marketing information.,The <i>New York Times</i> newspaper article mentioned the names of two scientists and a report in <i>Nature</i> magazine.  These are two sources of the story. The scientists were from Harvard and Yale, two well-known and well-respected institutions. That makes us more likely to accept the story.,The reporter also included a quote from another university, not involved in the research.  The use of a person not directly involved but with expertise in the area also makes us believe in the story.,The story is clear that a hypothesis is being presented.  Not all scientists accept the new theory.  The fact it is a relatively recent article also helps make you think it is a hypothesis, since other scientists have had little time to debate the theory or provide more empirical evidence that supports or disagrees with the theory.,Finding the empirical data is a bit harder, since the scientists summarize it in a highly technical article.

A person with dementia has symptoms such as loss of memory and loss of other brain processing capabilities. Athletes, including football players, sometimes suffer concussions.  ,In recent years, the topic of concussions in football and the effectiveness of football helmets have generated controversy.  Two groups, the National Football League (NFL) and the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment (NOCSAE), have been in the news with claims relating to the safety of the sport and the ratings of football helmets.  ,It is a story of marketing as well.

The first step is to be prepared − read and research the current information on concussions, drawing upon books, the Internet, local experts and your growing knowledge of physics and its models.<br />If this is a group project, have clear goals and deadlines for the team, and democratically decide roles and responsibilities.  For instance, with concussion research, one team member might research the NOCSAE website, another might research information critical of that group, and a third might consider how the physics you have learned applies to this topic. Keep all discussions civil!,When presenting, do more than lecture.  Ask and respond to questions.  Make sure you hear a variety of positions and respond thoughtfully.  If you are not sure about a question or comment, have the person make it clear.   Admit when others have valid, opposing ideas and conclusions, and politely challenge those that you doubt, or seek to resolve contradictions. This can help to promote a discussion that is creative, filled with different viewpoints. ,Your presentation may not be the end of your task.  It may (and perhaps should) provoke you to conduct further research or investigations over time, or, it may cause to review your conclusions.,What data do you have to support your hypothesis?  Presenting this as a chart or graph often makes it easier for your audience to understand.  We show that with a chart that breaks down the composition of the Universe. ,What are some sources of uncertainty, such as inaccurate models, theory that is not well-understood or accepted, reasons the instruments might be inaccurate, or other explanations for the data being off from expected values?  Can you quantify the effects of uncertainty, stating the amount by which the data might deviate from the accepted or true value? ,Consider also presenting the other side of the debate if the conclusions are uncertain.  The audience should hear alternate theories that are scientifically and logically well supported."

Take a free-throw shot or toss a tennis ball off a roof − you are witnessing projectile motion. ,Two factors determine a projectile’s motion.  One is its initial velocity.   In the first example, we just drop a cannonball, so its initial velocity is zero.    ,The cannonball falls to Earth.  Its vertical velocity changes because gravity is pulling it toward Earth. Vertically, it accelerates at −<i>g</i>, freefall acceleration.  The sign indicates its direction. (When discussing projectile motion, we often <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_air_resistance_concept2'>ignore air resistance</a>.)

Your challenge is to match the graph by setting the soccer ball’s initial velocity and the freefall acceleration.,The graph goes through exact grid points at the beginning, as the ball reaches its maximum height, and as the ball returns to the ground and stops. These grid point values should help you to calculate both the initial velocity and the acceleration.

We show the resulting vector in the graph.,Vector subtraction works similarly to addition when you use components. The components are subtracted.,To subtract vectors by using the components method, you subtract the corresponding components.  We show an example of subtraction in the second diagram. ,We subtract the <i>x</i>-component of <b>B</b> from that of <b>A</b>, and then do the same for the <i>y</i>-components. Remember that subtracting a negative number is the same as adding a positive. We write the vector in its component form."

An inverse function “undoes” another function. It takes the output of a function, and tells you that function’s original input. ,There are three inverse trigonometric functions we discuss: the arcsin, arccos, and arctan. These are abbreviations for arcsine, arccosine, and arctangent.  You may also see them referred to as sin<span class=\"math\"><sup>−</sup></span><sup class=\"\">1</sup>, cos<span class=\"math\"><sup>−</sup></span><sup class=\"\">1</sup> and tan<span class=\"math\"><sup>−</sup></span><sup class=\"\">1</sup>.  This  notation means inverse, not reciprocal!,We explain inverse functions using the sine function as an example.  To state it mathematically, if <span class=\"math\"><i>x</i> = sin <i>y</i>,</span> then </br><span class=\"math\"><i>y</i> = arcsin<i></i><i>x</i></span>. In other words, if you know that the sine of angle <i>y</i> is <i>x</i>, applying the arcsin to <i>x</i> will tell you the angle <i>y</i>. ,The other inverse functions are parallel in approach.  For instance, if <span class=\"math\"><i>x</i> = cos <i>y</i>,</span> then <span class=\"math\"><i>y</i> = arccos <i>x</i>.</span>,The sample problem asks us to calculate the angle A. The sine of A equals the opposite leg divided by the hypotenuse, which is 0.6.,Using a calculator that performs inverse trigonometric functions, we calculate arcsine of 0.6.  It is approximately 37°.,Be sure to double-check the quadrant for angles calculated from the inverse trigonometric function.  For instance, if the <span class=\"math\">arctan = 1</span>, a calculator will say that the original angle is 45°, but the angle 225° also has the same tangent function value.  Which angle is correct depends on the situation being described. "

His skepticism led him to some of the most important discoveries in physics.,You can conduct your own experiments concerning force, mass, and acceleration, and draw your own conclusions. In the simulation, you perform some of the basic tasks required of a helicopter pilot. To do so, you control the net force on the helicopter. You use the up and down arrow keys to set the net force. ,To start, apply a positive net force to cause the helicopter to rise off the ground. Next, attempt to have the helicopter reach a constant vertical velocity. For an optional challenge, have it hover at a constant height of 15 meters, and finally, attempt to land (not crash) the helicopter."

It can cause an object to speed up, slow down, and change direction.  ,A force pushes or pulls.  A ball hitting a bat, or Earth pulling you down are examples of forces, as is the alien pushing the shopping cart. Some forces require contact: a bat hitting a ball, a child pulling a wagon, and so on.  These are called contact forces.,Other forces do not require contact.  Earth pulls on the Moon with the gravitational force, keeping it in orbit − without touching it, of course.  Another example of force that does not require contact is the magnetic force. Two magnets can attract or repel without contact. ,Forces are vectors.  Their direction matters − the acceleration of an object will be in the same direction as the net force acting on it. The unit for force is the newton. ,Forces are a common part of our lives.  We have named many of them: friction, a force that opposes motion, or gravity, the force of masses attracting one another. To mention a third: tension is a force transmitted through a string or rope, as we show in the second diagram. "

Motor oil, Teflon™, WD-40™, Tri-Flo™ and many other products are designed to reduce this force. ,However, friction can be very useful.

Hooke’s law is specific to springs.  When stretched or compressed from equilibrium, or rest point, a spring produces a force that restores the spring to equilibrium.,You probably already know a few basic things about springs: You extend or stretch them, and they pull back on you. You compress or squeeze them, and they push back. ,Some springs are stiffer − harder to stretch or compress − than others.  The spring constant is a number given to a spring that describes how stiff it is.  A large constant means a stiff spring − one that is hard to stretch or compress. ,The magnitude of the spring’s force is proportional to how far a spring is displaced from its rest position.  As it is stretched or compressed, the amount of force increases. ,The equation says the force is the product of the spring constant and the displacement from the rest point. ,The spring force is a restoring force − one that pushes or pulls back to a rest point. It always points in the opposite direction of the displacement.  The negative sign in the equation shows that the force is in the opposite direction of the displacement."

Air resistance is the force due to air that opposes motion.  Air resistance changes with speed.  Air resistance plays a large role in many sports, from parachuting to bicycling.  The force is often called drag. ,The atmosphere is made up of molecules.  Although they are widely separated relative to their size and are small, there are many molecules!  When we collide with them, they oppose our motion, and the sum of all their resistance is called air resistance.  ,The amount of force due to air resistance is proportional to various factors, including the surface area facing the direction of motion.    ,For each object it is also proportional to a constant called the drag coefficient. A smooth, rounded surface has a lower drag coefficient than a rough, blocky one.  You can see this in car design, where smooth, curved surfaces are featured in most cars.,Drag also depends on the object’s speed, and is often modeled as being proportional to the speed squared.

In the simulation, which is launched by the lower graphic in this section, the force vectors on the block are drawn, but they are initially in the wrong directions, have the wrong magnitudes, or both. Your job is to fix the force vectors. If you do this correctly, the block will accelerate up the ramp at a rate of 4.3 m/s<sup class=\"\">2</sup>.,Determine the directions and calculate (to the nearest newton) the magnitudes of the weight, normal force, and friction force. ,We strongly recommend using the direction of the ramp as the <i>x</i>-direction and the direction perpendicular to the ramp as the <i>y</i>-direction.  In other words, rotate the axes so the force of the rope is parallel to the <i>x</i>-axis, and the normal force is perpendicular to the <i>y</i>-axis.  Imagine the coordinates being drawn on a clear piece of graph paper, and rotate the paper so the graph axes line up as described. This means that many forces are acting directly along an axis, so their components along the other axis will be zero.  This method is commonly used to solve this type of problem. ,Drag the head of a vector to set its magnitude and direction. You can also set the magnitudes in the control panel.

If the force is parallel to the displacement, as with two examples we show in this section, then work equals the product of the displacement and the force. ,How does work relate to force and displacement? A greater amount of work is done when the force parallel to the displacement is greater.  For instance, if you lift a heavy weight, like the weightlifter we show, you are doing more work than if you lift a paper clip through the same displacement.  ,And the amount of work increases with displacement.  If you lift the weight 2 meters, you are doing more work on it than if you lift it 2 centimeters. "

The magnitude of the force is assumed to be constant. ,If the force is in the opposite direction from the displacement, then the work done on the object will be negative, since the two vectors have opposite directions. ,Work and energy share a unit: the joule, pronounced like “jewel.”  As you can see, a joule is the product of a kilogram and meter squared, divided by second squared.

How do we calculate the work done? In this section, we show a way to approximate the amount of work done. ,In the diagram is a graph of a force that varies with displacement. As the graph shows, the force reaches a maximum when the displacement is two and a half meters. The area under the curve equals the work. If the graph of the force were made of straight lines, calculating the area underneath would be exact and relatively easy. But with a curve, a little more effort is required. ,One way to approximate the area under the curve is to fit a set of rectangles to the curve, as shown in the diagram. In this case, we use five rectangles, which give us a good approximation. If we wanted to be more accurate, we would use more rectangles. The more the merrier, and the more accurate. ,Why does this method work?  Work is the product of force and displacement.  For a small displacement, the force is approximately constant, and the area of each rectangle is the product, which approximates the work done over that small displacement.  Summing all the rectangles approximates the total area under the curve, which is the total work. "

Conservation of energy is a crucial concept in science. ,Energy is always conserved.  By “conserved,” we mean that it remains constant. Energy cannot “disappear” or be “magically” created.  The total amount of energy must stay the same.  ,The total energy of an isolated system stays constant − it is conserved. By an isolated system, we mean an object, or group of objects, that is not having energy transferred into or out of it.    ,For instance, as the boy swings up and down, the total energy of the system stays the same.  It may be all potential energy when he is standing on the cliff.,At the bottom of his swing, it is all kinetic energy. As he swings back and forth, potential energy may be changing into kinetic energy, and vice versa.  ,The key point is that the total energy of the system stays the same.  If we add it up, we will always get the same amount.  Scientists (and you, we hope) say that energy is conserved.   We should note that in extreme conditions, such as fusion within the Sun, we have to talk about mass-energy conservation, because Einstein’s <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_emc2'>theory of relativity</a> tells us that mass and energy are interchangeable.

We use the example of a 0.5-kilogram model rocket that is launched straight up in the air, at an initial velocity of 50 meters per second. It starts with zero potential energy, since it is on the ground.  Its potential energy increases until it gains its maximum height of 128 meters, since gravitational <i>PE</i> equals <i>mgh</i>. It then falls to the ground, and when it hits the ground at 10.2 seconds, its height is 0, so its <i>PE</i> is again 0. We have described the highlights of a gravitational potential energy graph. ,The kinetic energy of the projectile starts at a maximum, since the rocket’s speed is at its maximum.  It reaches its peak height at 5.1 seconds, and its speed there is 0, as its motion changes from rising to falling.  It falls back to the ground, and again reaches its maximum speed.  Its <i>KE</i> (proportional to the square of its velocity) is at the maximum at the beginning and end, and is zero when at the peak, when its speed is zero. This KE graph is also a parabola, the mirror image of the <i>PE</i> graph.,We sum the curves to find the total energy curve.  The total energy is always the same − 625 joules.  In our example (in which we ignore air resistance), the total energy is constant − it is conserved. "

Friction is removing kinetic energy from the car − and turning it into heat, for example, which enters the atmosphere.   ,When calculating the work done by a non-conservative force, the path of an object does matter.

You start by setting the initial velocity for both the blue and the red pucks and use these velocity settings to cause them to collide. ,The blue puck has a mass of 1.0 kg, and the red puck has a mass of 2.0 kg. There is no friction between the pucks and the shuffleboard. ,Using the activity, answer these questions. Does the collision of the pucks affect the sum of their velocities? In other words, does the sum of their velocities remain constant? Does the collision affect the sum of their momentums? Remember to consider positive and negative signs when summing these values. If the system’s momentum is the same after the collision, the momentum was conserved. For an optional challenge: Does the collision conserve the total kinetic energy of the pucks? If so, the collision is called an elastic collision."

A classic example of momentum being conserved is two pool balls colliding. The balls are moving with different velocities before and after the collision.

There are no external forces acting on it, just the forces between the two balls as they collide. If a net external force acts on a system − such as if a player strikes one of the balls with the cue stick − then the system’s momentum will change.,In short, momentum is conserved in an isolated system.

The harder it is to stay on the path, the more you are accelerating.  Fast, small circles are harder than slow, large circles."

The groundhog, shown at the North Pole, experiences a slightly greater acceleration due to gravity than he would at the equator. ,Freefall acceleration also varies because mass is not distributed uniformly inside the Earth.

Thought experiments, such as Newton’s cannon, is the term that describes physicists using their minds to conduct an experiment.   ,In the 17th century, Newton thought about what would happen if a very powerful cannon fired a projectile, like a stone, from a high mountain. Newton stated that, since Earth is curved, the faster the projectile, the farther it would travel around Earth.,Fired fast enough, at about 8,000 meters per second, the projectile would just keep going, never touching the ground. Due to the curvature of Earth, the projectile never falls far enough to touch the ground.,Why does a fast-moving projectile never hit the surface of Earth? Earth’s surface “falls away” just as fast as the projectile descends. In the second diagram, we show the horizontal and vertical motion of the projectile in one second.,A stone fired with horizontal velocity will fall five meters in about one second. It will not hit the ground because in the time it takes the stone to move 8,000 meters horizontally, Earth’s surface curves enough that the stone’s vertical descent keeps it the same distance from Earth.,The concept of Newton’s cannon applies to any orbiting bodies.  The Moon orbiting around Earth can be considered as a fast-moving projectile, and so can the Earth as it orbits the Sun."

Starting in 1609, the astronomer Johannes Kepler proposed the three basic laws of planetary motion.   ,Kepler demonstrated that all planets have elliptical orbits. For example, we show that Mars’ orbit around the Sun has an elliptical shape. This is his first law, and it applies to satellites, including Earth, orbiting any massive central body, such as the Sun. It applies equally well to the Moon orbiting the Earth.,Kepler observed that the Sun is located at one focus of every planetary orbit. A focus is one of two points that defines an ellipse.  A circle is an ellipse in which the two focal points coincide, so Kepler’s law applies to circular orbits as well. "

It moves slower when it is farther from the Sun and faster when it is closer.,Kepler’s second law uses the concept of the area swept out by the line between the planet and the Sun. The pale yellow “pie slice” in the diagram indicates the area swept out during an interval of time. ,Kepler’s second law states that along any portion of its orbit, a planet will sweep out an equal area in an equal amount of time. Because the sectors you see were swept out in equal amounts of time, their areas are equal. Kepler’s laws can be proven using Newton’s laws. ,We use the example of a planet that could be Earth or any planet orbiting the Sun, but Kepler’s second law applies to any satellite orbiting around any body, for example, Halley’s comet orbiting the Sun.

For each planet, it plots the semimajor axis on the <i>y</i>-axis versus the period on the <i>x</i>-axis. (For an elliptical orbit, the semimajor axis is one half the width of the orbit at its widest. For a circular orbit, this is the same as the radius <i class=\"math0\">r</i>.)

The reverse happens when the satellite moves farther from Earth − the kinetic energy decreases and the potential energy increases, becoming less negative and rising toward zero. The total energy is constant.,You may have noticed that the potential energy is always negative for satellites. By convention, the zero configuration for gravitational potential energy in the case of orbits is defined as the configuration with infinite separation.

Whatever physics the Greeks did not first pioneer, it often seems that Sir Isaac Newton was the source. However, the application of the theory of gravity to the orbits of astronomical objects was a team effort. ,One inspiration to scientists of his era was comets.  These showy objects inspired scientists to understand their orbits, in part to predict when they would return. A crucial piece of the puzzle was what we now call Kepler’s laws of orbits.  Based on observations made by the Danish scientist Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler had concluded that planets move in elliptical orbits, and deduced other aspects of their <a class='pjumpToTopic' href='javascript:void(0)' data-chap='1' data-topic='4' data-subtopic='1' data-subsection='0'>motion</a>.  However, he could not explain why. ,Technology also played a crucial role.  In the decades preceding Newton, optical <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_reflecting_telescope_concepts'>telescopes</a> were conceived of, built, and significantly improved. Previously, astronomy had been done without the benefit of lenses or mirrors..  Scientists across the world could now make astronomical observations. Newton used geometry and his theory of gravity to explain the observed elliptical orbits.  Edmond Halley in turn used Newton’s work to determine the orbit and <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_UCM_period_concept'>period</a>of the comet we now call Halley’s comet. In the 20<sup class=\"\">th</sup> century, spacecraft from multiple countries including Japan and joint efforts from Europe could even “visit” the comet to study scientists’ theories about the nature of comets.,In the 1900s, Einstein further developed the theory of gravity in his <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_general_rel'>general theory of relativity</a>.   General relativity revolutionized the way we think about space and time, and it has also had important experimental effects.

Tangential velocity allows us to relate the ideas of linear and angular velocity. ,To discuss these concepts, we use the salt and pepper shakers you see in the upper diagram. Because they are revolving at the same rate, the salt and pepper shakers on the rotating lazy Susan have the same angular velocity. However, at any instant, they have different linear velocities − the salt shaker is moving faster since it travels a greater distance than the pepper shaker. The instantaneous linear velocity of a point on a rotating object is called its tangential velocity.,The magnitude of the tangential velocity of an object equals the magnitude of its linear velocity, or speed, at an instant in time. The salt shaker has a greater speed because it is farther from the axis of rotation than the pepper shaker, so it travels a greater distance during any time interval. ,The direction of tangential velocity is always tangent to the circle of motion of the object.

Torque can cause an object to rotate, or change the rate of rotation of an object. Here, the torque applied by the hand causes the wrench to rotate.,The amount of torque depends in part on the amount of force.

We show the angle that is used to calculate the torque in the diagram, using the example of a child’s weight exerting a torque on a seesaw.  The angle is measured between the force and a position vector with magnitude <i>r</i>. The position vector starts at the axis of rotation and ends at the point at which the force is applied.,The amount of torque depends on the angle at which the force is applied relative to the seesaw.  The force component that creates the torque is the component that is perpendicular to the lever, which is the seesaw in our example. ,The equation we show is used to calculate the torque when the force is applied at any angle relative to the position vector.  If the force is perpendicular to the lever, then the angle is 90°.  The sine of 90° is 1, which means the entire force is multiplied by the distance to the axis of rotation.  If the force is parallel, then the angle is 0 or 180°, the sine of those angles is 0, and no torque is applied.

There are no horizontal forces. The downward forces of the weights of the children are balanced by the upward normal force of the fulcrum, the triangle shape that supports the seesaw.,The seesaw is not rotating, which means there is no net torque acting on it. Why? Since the normal force of the fulcrum acts at the axis of rotation, it exerts no torque because the distance is zero. The negative (clockwise) torque on the seesaw applied by the boy is balanced by the positive (counterclockwise) torque due to the girl, which means they sum to zero. With no motion, no net force, and no net torque, the seesaw is in static equilibrium. "

That is what the pulley shown in the upper diagram does − a downward pull on the chain lifts up the bucket.,A machine can also change the amount of force or torque. Having more than one pulley means that a person pulling on a rope causes a greater force to be applied to lift the load, though for a shorter distance.  In a similar way, a lever can increase the applied force, at the cost of a smaller displacement. ,We show the six types of simple machines: pulley, lever, inclined plane, wedge, screw and wheel/axle.

As altitude increases, pressure decreases. This is why jetliners must have pressurized cabins at cruising altitudes − the air pressure at 10,000 meters is about a quarter of what it is at sea level. ,The density of the air decreases with altitude as well. There are fewer molecules per cubic meter at higher altitudes than at lower ones.

Changes in pressure can indicate that a change of weather is on the way.,Barometers measure atmospheric pressure. A barometer works by having the pressure of a column of fluid, often mercury, balance the pressure of the atmosphere on the surface of a reservoir. ,The mercury height is measured in millimeters. The height, <i>h,</i> of the column of mercury is typically about 760 mm at sea level. By definition, the pressure exerted by 760 mm of mercury, also called 760 torr, equals one standard atmosphere of pressure. "

Surface tension explains why paintbrush bristles contract, how dewdrops form on roses, and how water striders can walk on water. ,The bristles of a dry paintbrush can spread outward. In contrast, the bristles of a wet paintbrush move together because of the surface tension of the water they hold. The surface of the liquid contracts, pulling the bristles together. ,In some liquids, including water, molecules have negatively and positively charged regions that attract each other. For water molecules below the surface, these forces exist in all directions, so there is no net force on any interior molecule.  ,For water molecules at the surface, there are no molecules above them. This means there is a net force pulling them inward and causing the surface to contract. This cohesive behavior is called “surface tension.”,The spherical nature of dewdrops on the rose is due to surface tension.  The force of surface tension causes the water to minimize its surface area, with that surface area minimized in the form of a sphere. ,The surface tension of a pond supports the weight of the water strider. As it moves across the water, its weight causes its feet to depress the surface, but not to break through. The surface tension provides a force that balances the insect’s weight."

Objects float because of the upward buoyant force of a fluid like water.,The amount of buoyant force equals the weight of the displaced fluid. In the illustration, the wood block is less dense than water, so when it is partly submerged, the weight of the water it displaces is equal to the block’s weight.

The net force down means the steel bar sinks.,If an object is less dense than water, it only has to be partially submerged to float.  When the wood block is submerged as shown, the weight of the water it displaces is equal to the block’s weight, and there is no net force.  The block will stay at this level.,The ship floats even though steel is denser than water.  If the ship were solid steel, it would sink.,The ship’s steel structure contains air and other materials − it is not solid steel.  The average density of the ship is less than that of water.  When this amount of the boat is submerged, it floats.,This also explains why ships will sink if water floods in, as with the <i>Titanic</i>.  Water is denser than air, and the combination of steel and water is denser than water alone.  A ship full of water has greater average density than water, and will sink."

A diver, and his equipment, are often less dense than water.  The rubber wetsuit he wears to stay warm also reduces his average density.  To sink, he puts on a weight belt, made of a dense metal. This gives a diver a net force down, and he sinks.,A diver does not want to continue sinking, but wants to have no net vertical force acting on him when he reaches his desired depth.  He could simply drop weights off his belt, but then he would always be buying new weights.,Instead, a diver may have an inflatable vest that expands when filled with air from a cartridge.  This reduces his average density and lets him have the same density as water.  With the inflatable vest, he can also address changes in his density, such as pressure compressing his wetsuit, which increases his average density."

His Royal Highness asked Archimedes to discover whether this was indeed the case.,Archimedes considered the problem for days. Then, one day, in the public bath, he observed how the water level in the pool rose as he eased himself in for a good soak, and suddenly realized that the answer was right in front of his eyes. Overjoyed, he supposedly leapt from the bath and ran dripping through the streets of the city crying “Eureka!” (I have found it!) The “impure” crown was quickly identified, and the goldsmith roundly punished.,Your task is to determine the nature of Archimedes’ insight and apply it in the simulation to the left. You have two crowns and a bar of pure gold. You have already measured their masses using a balance scale. You can measure the volume of a crown or bar in the simulation by dragging it to the bath and noting how much water it displaces. You see the tube that measures the displaced liquid in the illustration at the right. Decide which crown has been altered and drag it to the king’s palace. The appropriate consequences will occur!"

Pascal’s principle is applied in hydraulic lifts, as we discuss in this section.,Pascal’s principle states that an enclosed fluid transmits pressure unchanged. Here you see two stationary blocks of different masses, chosen so that the same fluid supports each of them. Why? Because the pressure is the same underneath both masses. The more massive block applies more downward force than the smaller block, but it applies it over a proportionally greater area. This means the pressure is the same on both sides. For the pressure to be equal, it is important that the two points must be at the same depth, as they are here.,The ratio of force to area equals the pressure, and that is the same on both sides.  This is why the system balances the blocks.,The first equation states that pressure at one point in an enclosed fluid is the same as at any other point at the same depth.,The second equation states the same principle using the definition of pressure."

We start with <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_thermal_energy_concepta'>thermal energy</a>, which is the energy of matter due to the energy of its molecules.  Examples of thermal energy include molecules vibrating or potential energy due to bonds in a solid.  ,You are familiar with the concept of <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_thermal_energy_temperature1'>temperature</a>, perhaps from daily weather forecasts.  Temperature is the measure of the average <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_kinetic_energy_definition'>kinetic energy</a> of molecules. The thermal energy that molecules possess also includes potential energy, which is harder to measure. When thermal energy increases in matter, the temperature increases or the matter changes state, such as from a liquid to a gas.,  <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_heat_concepts1'>Heat</a> is the transfer of thermal energy.  Heat flows spontaneously − without outside work − from hotter objects to colder ones.  It takes work to cause heat to flow from colder objects to hotter objects.  Heat transfers due to the interactions of molecules as they transfer kinetic energy.  Put your hand on a cup of hot chocolate, and you are experiencing heat. "

There are four different states of matter: gas, liquid, solid, and plasma.  The relationship of molecules to each other within the matter defines the state. For instance, in a gas, molecules have no fixed relationship, but just collide like balls on a pool table.  With a solid, molecules are locked into a far more rigid relationship.,To discuss specific types of matter, we start with solids. We use an iron paper clip as an example of a solid. A paper clip is made up of about a billion trillion iron atoms, bonded together tightly in a repeating, crystal-like structure.  We show a representation of such a structure in the diagram.,Heat transferring to the paper clip causes the iron molecules to vibrate more, which can be measured as an increased temperature.  Typically, metals expand slightly when their temperature increases. ,Increasing the paper clip’s temperature to more than <span class=\"ft\">1500°C causes the iron atoms to begin moving apart so much that the bonds between them start to break</span>. When the bonds between the atoms in a solid break, the solid melts into a liquid."

With our example of water, we show that each water molecule is held to nearby water molecules by relatively weak intermolecular bonds.,As with solids, when heat transfers to a liquid, the molecules begin moving faster and its temperature increases. At the boiling point, as heat continues to flow, the intermolecular bonds holding the liquid molecules together begin to break. The liquid begins to change to a gas."

Exothermic A chemical reaction that emits (releases) heat. Endothermic and exothermic are ways to classify chemical processes, relating heat energy and a system’s potential energy.   ,In an endothermic reaction, heat is absorbed by the reactants (the substances that are part of the reaction). Examples of endothermic reactions include evaporation of water and baking an egg.  In exothermic reactions, heat is released during the process. Examples of exothermic reactions include combustion (such as a candle flame) and condensation of rain from water vapor.  ,In chemical reactions, chemical bonds are either formed or broken.  In general, when chemical bonds are formed, heat is released, and when bonds are broken, heat is absorbed.  Why? Molecules want to stay together, so breaking them apart requires energy input (heat).  When molecules join together, typically heat is released.,We use a potential energy diagram to illustrate the reactions.  Endothermic reactions require heat to be absorbed, and that energy increases the potential energy of the reactants.,With exothermic reactions, heat is released, and the potential energy of the reactants decreases.  Activation energy − the energy required to get the reactions occurring −creates an initial spike of energy with exothermic reactions. But the main points hold: Heat energy absorbed increases the potential energy of the reactants in endothermic reactions, and heat energy released decreases the potential energy of the reactants in exothermic reactions."

Macroscopic A description of the overall properties of an object. Microscopic A description of properties within an object. Welcome to thermodynamics, one of the main fields in physics and physical science.  Three main topics in thermodynamics are <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_heat_concepts1'>heat</a>, <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_work_concept'>work</a>, and <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_thermal_energy_concepta'>thermal energy</a>.   Relating these topics allows us to discuss and understand engines, such as the one we show from a car.    ,Thermodynamics provides a model for understanding engines. Engines convert thermal energy into mechanical work, resulting in a car’s acceleration, and heat transfer is an essential element in how they function.  Thermodynamics includes topics such as how efficient an engine is, which tells us how much of the thermal energy transferred to an engine can be converted to useful work. ,Thermodynamics covers both microscopic and macroscopic properties, typically focusing more on macroscopic properties. If you put the pot on a burner and turn on the heat, you will change the microscopic properties of the pot’s contents. If you were viewing an individual molecule, it might vibrate faster, move to a new location, or form new relationships with other molecules, ones with different potential energy.  The exact result would differ from molecule to molecule. ,A macroscopic property, the water’s thermal energy, would increase.  The water’s temperature, another macroscopic property reflecting the average kinetic energy of all molecules, would also increase.  In thermodynamics, it often proves very useful to focus more on macroscopic properties, such as the water’s temperature. "

If you look at water in a stationary pot on a stove, you may not see the water moving, but the water contains thermal energy. ,Thermodynamics focuses on types of energy <b>within</b> an object.  Molecules in a fluid or solid interact with one another, and the strength of the interaction depends on the distance between the molecules.  This means they have potential energy.  ,The molecules also can have kinetic energy, as they rotate, translate, or vibrate.  Translation means motion that involves movement from one point to another, such as translating from Earth to Pluto. Molecules translate in fluids. For instance, the molecules in a gas fly around a container at hundreds of kilometers per hour. ,Even with the more fixed structure of a solid − say a brick that is part of a building − the molecules that make it up are vibrating and rotating. One model for the vibration motion of molecules in a solid is a spring: the molecules move back and forth as though they are masses connected by springs, possessing both kinetic and potential energy.   ,To give you a sense of thermal energy quantities, the amount of thermal energy required to warm one kilogram of ice from its coldest possible temperature and then melt it is roughly equivalent to the amount of energy that a kilogram would have if it were moving about <span class=\"math\">1,350 m/s</span>, which is about <span class=\"math\">4,860 km/h</span>.

The scale of the thermometer measures the amount of expansion − how much longer the column becomes as the liquid’s thermal energy increases.,Thermostats, which contain thermometers, are used to control furnaces and air conditioners.

For example, at room temperature, the ice cubes we show will melt, changing into a liquid. Different materials change between solid, liquid, and gas at different temperatures. For instance, ice melts at a far lower temperature than iron does. ,Energy must be added to ice, in the form of heat flow, for it to melt into water. Changing from solid to liquid, liquid to gas, or solid to gas requires the addition of energy.  ,Water changes from a solid to a liquid in the temperature range in which humans dwell. This serves to moderate temperature changes − for instance, the polar ice caps melting serves to moderate the Earth’s temperature as atmospheric temperature increases.  However, if the water does not freeze again during the winter, the polar ice will disappear, and the planet loses one factor that moderates its temperature. ,Heat also flows when liquid water freezes or steam condenses into liquid water. In these cases, heat flows out of the water. The amount of heat flowing in or out during a state change depends on the material, its amount, and which state change is occurring.,Although energy, in the form of heat, is being added or released during a state change, the temperature of the material remains constant. For example, ice cubes remain at 0°C as they melt into liquid water."

In this section, we discuss some ways this can be quantified.,An object radiates energy at a rate that is proportional to its Kelvin temperature raised to the <b>fourth</b> power, and to its surface area. The Sun is both hot − about 6,000 kelvins at its surface − and huge − its surface area is six billion square meters. This means it radiates an enormous amount of energy every second.,The energy from the Sun travels in all directions. Some strikes Earth’s atmosphere. The power of the Sun’s radiation, the energy per second that reaches our planet, is  1.8×10<sup class=\"\">17</sup> watts. ,About 20 kilowatts reaches the roof of the average American house, which is about four times the power that a house uses. You see a solar collector on the roof of a house. It uses the energy of the Sun’s radiation to warm water used in the home.  ,Such systems are not perfectly efficient, so even though enough solar power may reach the house during sunny periods, it cannot necessarily power the house around the clock.  Other factors such as the initial cost and storing energy for the night are obstacles that can be surmounted with good design and sufficient investment. "

Understanding global warming requires understanding the greenhouse effect. ,In turn, explaining the greenhouse effect requires a few steps. We start with radiation from the Sun reaching Earth. Earth absorbs some of this radiation.,The transparent gases in the atmosphere of our planet do not stop much sunlight from passing through to Earth’s surface, but they do absorb the infrared radiation that is emitted from the warmed Earth. ,The gases in the atmosphere absorb radiation, then re-emit that radiation. Some of it leaves Earth’s atmosphere, but some goes back to the surface of Earth. ,The radiation that returns to the surface of Earth causes it to be warmer than it would be without the presence of the atmosphere. This is called the “greenhouse effect.” This process has gone on for millions of years, and it occurs on other planets with atmospheres as well. ,The current concern about global warming and the greenhouse effect centers on the nature of the gases that make up the atmosphere. The burning of coal and petroleum has increased the amount of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere. This increases the magnitude of the greenhouse effect. "

Let’s contrast them. ,Conduction occurs when thermal energy locally transfers from particle to particle.  It is the passing of thermal energy between nearby particles within a substance, without overall motion of the medium. Generally, conduction occurs only in solids.,Convection is the thermal transfer of energy by the circulation, or movement, of warmer (more energetic) fluid matter. The energy is exchanged by the flow of the warmer matter, and the cooler matter that moves to replace it.,Radiation is the transfer of energy through space by electromagnetic radiation. ,In sum, both conduction and convection involve matter, but conduction is the transfer of thermal energy by local collisions within matter, while convection involves the bulk movement of matter.  Radiation is heat transfer not via matter or collisions within matter, but by electromagnetic radiation."

So as fall approaches and the cool air chills the lake, the top layer of water gets colder, contracts, and sinks. You may have experienced this effect if you have jumped into a lake. The water is colder the deeper you go. This chilling and sinking of the top layer continues until the lake is 4°C throughout.,Unlike other fluids, water <b>expands</b> instead of contracting as it cools from 4°C to 0°C. So, once the lake reaches 4°C, the top layer continues to cool but does not sink. Now the top layer is less dense, so it floats atop the warmer and denser water beneath. ,At 0°C, water turns to ice. Ice is also less dense than the 4°C water beneath, so it floats. This creates an ice layer on top of the water, insulating the water below. This phenomenon is crucial for aquatic life. It means the water under the ice in most ponds and lakes stays liquid. If water always contracted with cooler temperatures, lakes would freeze from the bottom up, and would be much more likely to become completely solid. "

We discuss this relationship using a simple engine system. ,As you can see in the diagram, our model of an engine includes a container that holds a gas. A flame supplies heat to the engine. ,The heat added by the flame can increase the gas’s thermal energy.  The gas molecules have greater kinetic energy and move faster.

It requires work to pump the heat out of the refrigerator.,The cycle begins with a cold refrigerant in a heat-exchanging pipe. The liquid refrigerant is cooler than the air inside the refrigerator.,Heat flows spontaneously from the warmer inside of the refrigerator to the cooler refrigerant, making the refrigerant warmer and the refrigerator’s interior cooler.   Energy is conserved − only its location is being changed. ,The heat flow to the refrigerant increases its energy until it becomes a gas.

There are two types of heat pumps. We start with the more traditional type of heat pump.,The first diagram shows a traditional type of heat pump. Work done on the gas in the pump causes heat to flow from a colder location to a warmer one.  (Heat will not flow spontaneously from cold to hot, so work is required.)  You may notice that this type of heat pump is the same as a heat engine, but run in reverse, with work causing this direction of heat flow.,Buildings use this form of heat pump to more efficiently warm their interiors. Heat pumps can be more efficient than traditional furnaces since they take advantage of thermal energy in the environment. ,In the second diagram, we show a geothermal heat pump. A geothermal heat pump has pipes running underground where the earth is warmer.  The liquid there absorbs thermal energy.,A pump then propels the liquid up, into the building’s interior. The thermal energy of the gas is conserved as it moves from location to location.,Heat flows from the liquid to the building interior, and then the liquid repeats this cycle. In other words, the cooler liquid is pumped back underground, absorbs thermal energy, and is pumped up once again. "

The piston is locked in place. As heat flows from the hot reservoir into the engine, the gas’s thermal energy increases.

The first law of thermodynamics applies: Heat increases the thermal energy of a system when no work is done.,The second process is summarized in the second diagram. The piston is unlocked, and the gas does work on the piston, causing it to rise. Some heat also exits the engine into the cold reservoir. During this process, the pressure and temperature decrease.

One uses the definition: Efficiency equals the work done by the engine, divided by the energy supplied to it.,The equation on the right states efficiency in terms of heat flow in and out of an engine.  The lower the ratio of heat out to heat in, the more efficient the engine is.  This makes sense − heat out is wasted heat.    ,Real-world engines tend to be 30% to 60% efficient.

The second law tells us that a cold quart of ice cream in a hot car always absorbs heat from the car. The ice cream never becomes colder and the car warmer. ,Heat can be forced to flow from cold to hot: It just takes work to do so.  It does not flow in that direction spontaneously. A refrigerator is an example where work is done on a system (the refrigerator), causing heat to leave a colder environment (the refrigerator’s interior) and move to a warmer one (the kitchen).

Engines provide a good example of how some energy can become less useful, due to increasing disorder.,For instance, as the gas inside an engine warms up, gas particles collide with the wall of the engine, increasing the random kinetic energy of the engine wall and its temperature.  In a car engine, with walls that are not perfect insulators, you would notice this as a warmer engine.,This energy does not contribute to the work the engine does, but just adds to the random motion of the particles that are part of the engine.

Strictly speaking, this equation assumes that the process of heat transfer is reversible − it can occur in either direction.,When heat flows into a system, its thermal energy and entropy increase. If heat flows out, the sign for heat is negative and the system’s entropy decreases. We use a graph that represents the relationship of the entropy and the temperature of a particular system. ,As heat is transferred to an object or system, its entropy increases. Greater energy means more random motion of the molecules that make up the object. We illustrate this with two regions.,The equation can be used to confirm the required direction of heat flow between objects in a system, from hot to cold.  The entropy gained by a colder object in a system is greater than the entropy lost by a hotter object in the same system.  Why? Because <i>T</i> (temperature) is in the denominator, and dividing by a smaller denominator (the colder temperature) means the positive entropy change term is larger. This results in a net increase in entropy, and we see that the overall entropy must increase or stay the same.,If the heat were to spontaneously flow in the other direction, then the entropy of an isolated system could decrease, but that is impossible."

As we said earlier, the second law states that no engine is 100% efficient. ,In considering real-world engines, such an internal combustion engine in a car, one can detect the signs of “waste” heat being produced.  Some of the energy produced by burning the gasoline goes to the useful work of making the car move, but some of the energy exits the tailpipe as heat, which does no useful work.,One way to detect the heat is just to feel the hot hood of a car after it has been running. Also, a car engine’s radiator is designed to absorb heat. As it absorbs that heat, the temperature of the fluid in the radiator rises. The temperature increase means that entropy increases. This increase in entropy confirms that the engine is not 100% efficient. ,In addition to using our real-world engine as an example, we can use the model of the heat engine that we used earlier. A 100% efficient engine would absorb heat from the hot reservoir, lowering the entropy of the hot reservoir, convert all of the heat to mechanical work, and then return to its initial state, without having transferred any heat to the cold reservoir. This would mean that the entropy of the universe decreased, which violates the second law."

Simple harmonic motion (SHM) describes a specific type of periodic motion. ,To start your study of SHM, try the activity. An air hockey puck is attached to a spring, and glides without friction or air resistance over an air hockey table, which you view from overhead. When the puck is pushed and released, it moves in simple harmonic motion.,A pen is attached to the puck, and paper underneath it scrolls to the left over time. This produces a graph of the displacement over time. ,You can change the amplitude and period of the puck’s motion. The amplitude is the maximum displacement of the puck. The period is the time it takes the puck to complete one full cycle of motion.,As you play with the controls, make a few observations.

The puck continues moving beyond this point due to its momentum.,Note that “equilibrium” does not mean “at rest.”  The puck is moving at its fastest at equilibrium.  Equilibrium means there is no force.,As the puck continues its motion past equilibrium, the spring is compressed and it again exerts a restoring force. This force opposes the motion of the puck, slowing it down. ,The spring compresses until the puck stops momentarily. At this point, the force is again at its maximum amount, but opposite in direction from the force that started the motion. The puck reverses direction and moves toward equilibrium.

Why? To answer, we use <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_hooke_concept'>Hooke’s law</a> and <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_newton_second_law_concept'>Newton’s second law</a>. Hooke’s law states that for a given displacement, the greater the spring constant, the greater the force. This means there will be greater acceleration and the mass will both reach its peak velocity and return to zero velocity more quickly. This gives you reason to think the period of motion decreases with the spring constant.,In contrast, by Newton’s second law acceleration is inversely proportional to mass. As the mass increases, the acceleration decreases, so the period of a mass on a spring will increase with mass.,Notice that the period depends only on the mass and spring constant, not on the amplitude. When the amplitude increases, the mass has to travel farther during a cycle. However, increasing the amplitude also increases the maximum force applied to the mass, which increases its maximum acceleration and results in a greater average speed. The increased average speed means the mass completes the cycle in the same amount of time."

For example, if the amplitude doubles, the wave carries four times as much energy per unit time.,Why does energy increase with amplitude? Think about creating a wave on a string.  If you shake it with little force and little displacement, you create a wave with little displacement − a small amplitude.  The small amount of force and displacement you applied means you did little work on the string, which means you did not increase its energy very much.,On the other hand, imagine you gave the string long, hard shakes.  The amplitude of the wave will be larger.  And in this case, you have done more work, and the work has produced a greater increase in the string’s energy."

They do use frequencies that we cannot hear.    ,The chart displays the audible range of sound frequencies for humans and some animals. Although dogs are famed for hearing a wide range of frequencies, bats and dolphins actually have far wider hearing ranges.,Some musical instruments are designed to play notes below the lowest limit of human hearing (20 Hz). For example, the organ in the Sydney, Australia Town Hall can play a low, low C that vibrates at only 8 Hz, a rumbling that can only be felt by the audience members. Low frequency sounds are also used in movies and some arcade games to increase tension and suspense."

We discuss how a standing wave can be created by a wave reflecting.  This proves useful in discussing musical instruments such as a guitar, where a wave encounters endpoints and reflects back to form a standing wave.  It is also an example of resonance in waves. ,You see a string with one end fastened to a wall. A pulse is sent down the string. It is reflected at the wall − it changes direction.  It also is inverted: A peak returns as a trough, and a trough as a peak. ,The nature of the reflected pulse is explained by Newton’s third law. When the pulse reaches the wall, the string exerts a force on the wall. In turn, the wall exerts an equal and opposite force on the string. This equal and opposite force inverts the pulse and sends it back along the string.,When a periodic wave is sent down the string, the wave reflects, and its reflection moves in the direction opposite to the original wave. The reflection has the same amplitude and wavelength as the initial wave.,Earlier, you explored what happened when identical waves moving in opposite directions encountered each other. The result is a standing wave, created by two identical traveling waves moving in opposite directions.  Reflection can create a standing wave.,In our example, we are showing multiple wave pulses shaking the string.  They are in resonance with the string − vibrating at a natural frequency that increases the amplitude of the wave.  You can see this by contrasting the heights of the peaks and troughs in the first and second diagrams."

However, resonance can have a major impact in determining the effect of seismic waves − for example, the impact of an earthquake on a building is magnified if the waves resonate with its natural frequencies.  Resonance also determines the notes that a musical instrument plays.  ,Resonance describes a system that has a periodic driving force acting upon it, causing a large increase in its oscillation amplitude. The video shows a famous example of resonance, the Tacoma Narrows Bridge.  You can see that the bridge is moving as a wave, as it moves up and down. ,The collision of the wind with the bridge caused a driving frequency that was close to the natural frequency of the bridge. The wind effect was in resonance with the wave motion of the bridge.  It caused oscillations of increasing amplitude over time and collapsed the bridge.,Water waves in a sink or bathtub also provide a simple way to see and investigate a behavior of waves, resonance. ,Waves of certain frequencies are reinforced and amplified as they travel in a bathtub or sink based on factors such as the size and shape (dimensions) of the tank.  The amplitude of the standing wave increases when two waves overlap and a peak encounters another peak.  The amplitude would decrease when a peak meets a trough. "

We discuss the relationship of wavelength, frequency, and harmonics. The string will have a particular moving wave speed, based on properties such as tension in the string, and mass per unit length.  This is why many musical instruments have adjustable tension − so that the moving wave speed on the string can be set by the musician.   ,The possible wavelengths of harmonics is determined by the harmonics. We determined the possible wavelengths of harmonics, but we want to relate them to the possible frequencies, since that is how we perceive sound.  ,To solve for frequency, we use an equation we’ve seen: <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_wave_speed_concept'>Wave speed</a> equals the product of  wavelength and frequency.  We solve the equation for frequency, showing that  wavelength and frequency have an inverse relationship − for instance, double the wavelength and the frequency must be halved when the wave speed stays constant.,We apply these relationships to the harmonics. The first harmonic has the greatest wavelength and the smallest frequency.  The second harmonic has half the wavelength of the first harmonic so it must have twice the frequency, and the third harmonic has one-third the wavelength of the first harmonic and triple the frequency. As you can see, each frequency is an integer multiple of the smallest frequency, which is often called the “fundamental frequency.”   ,Let’s tie this all back to a musical instrument, the piano.  Its strings have different lengths, which means it allows different wavelengths.  Each string also has different thicknesses and tensions, which determine its wave speed.

A wave reflecting off an opening may not seem logical, but consider the nature of sound waves: They are alternating regions of higher and lower pressure. The region outside a pipe remains at a constant atmospheric pressure, acting like a wall to the wave. ,The reflected sound waves create a standing wave, just as on a string.

In contrast to Fourier analysis, which can be used to analyze the harmonic components of musical notes, MIDI uses digital notation to determine the notes that are played. ,Both MIDI and the music you hear on a typical CD use <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_encode'>digital formats</a> to describe the music.  But a music CD records music that started as a sound wave, such as a note played by a piano in a recording studio, and converts that into the format a computer or music player can read and reproduce.,In contrast, MIDI starts by describing a note digitally.  The note might start by a piano player pressing a key.  MIDI then describes the note: its frequency, how long it was played, its tempo, and so on.,Using a MIDI device, a musician can switch from, say, playing an organ to a piano by simply flipping a switch, instead of having to acquire these two instruments. ,To provide a comparison: a camcorder is one way to record a dance, and that is like a music CD.  But if a choreographer describes a dance − two steps forward and a grand jeté − that is like MIDI.,One benefit of MIDI is that files it creates are small, since they contain just the instructions for music.  MIDI is also supported by all digital musical instrument companies, so music recorded on one MIDI instrument can be played back, or edited, on another. "

In the video, you see and hear a tone at a particular frequency.,In the video, you hear a second tone, whose frequency is slightly different. When the frequencies of two sound waves are slightly different, you can hear beats when the two sounds are combined. ,In the video, you can hear beats in the combined sound. You will hear periods of louder and softer sounds. A cycle of loud to soft and back is called a beat.,The frequency of the beats equals the difference in the frequency of the two sounds. To make this the required positive number, take the absolute value of the frequency difference. "

The charges are distributed randomly.  ,When allowed to move, they travel as far away from one another as they can. They do this since like charges repel, and this reduces the forces between them. They stop moving and are in electrostatic equilibrium.,An important consequence of the charge configuration at electrostatic equilibrium is the resulting electric field.  Outside of a charged, solid conducting sphere, there is an electric field generated by the charges on the surface. More important is the lack of a field inside the sphere. We show a chunk of the sphere as transparent so you can see inside it.

(Despite the name, emf is a potential difference, not a force.) The abbreviation emf stands for “electromotive force.” Although emf includes the word “force,” it is a measure of potential difference, and its unit is the volt.,Batteries are a common source of emf in a direct current circuit. They typically create energy from complex chemical reactions.  ,Like all devices, batteries are not “ideal” but lose some of their emf over time − something you note every time you recharge a cell phone. Batteries also are a source of resistance in a circuit, which is called a battery’s internal resistance.  ,Batteries are often described as the “energy pump” in a circuit.  They raise the energy of the electrons, just like a pump could raise the gravitational potential energy of water.,Batteries have two terminals − connection points with different electric potential. One terminal is positively charged and the other is negatively charged. The potential difference of the battery, often called the voltage or emf, is the potential difference between the two terminals. ,For instance, an AAA battery supplies 1.5 volts, while a typical car battery operates at 12 volts. The voltage is the potential difference between them.,Batteries also differ by how much energy they can supply over their lifetimes.  Both AAA and D batteries supply 1.5 volts, but the larger D batteries last longer.  "

Components can be wired in parallel. “In parallel” means the components are separated by junctions where current can branch and divide.   ,In a parallel circuit, the current can take more than one path as it moves around the circuit. When current encounters a junction, it splits, as you can see at the junction labeled B. At junction A, the two currents join each other. This differs from a series circuit, where there is only one path for the current and it is the same at all points.,The amount of current can differ by location in a parallel circuit. For instance, each branch of this circuit containing one or two light bulbs carries less current than the branch containing the battery.,Current is composed of charge, and charge is always conserved.  This means the current exiting a junction must equal the current entering a junction. For example,  <i>I</i><sub class=\"\">1 </sub>+ <i>I</i><sub class=\"\">2</sub> = <i>I</i> in our circuit.,Although the current can differ, the potential difference across each branch of the parallel circuit is the same. If you measured the potential difference across the battery, you would get a reading of 1.5 V. You would get the same reading if you connected a voltmeter across the middle branch of the circuit at the junctions B and A. ,You would also get a measurement of 1.5 V across C and D, the endpoints of the far right branch.

Earth’s magnetic field determines the direction of a compass needle. ,Earth’s magnetic south pole is located very close to what we call the North Pole. Before magnets were well understood, scientists decided that the “north” end of a compass needle should point toward the North Pole. Since opposites attract, the geographic North Pole of our planet is in fact close to its magnetic south pole.,On the other hand, a location near Earth’s geographic South Pole is a magnetic north pole. The south end of a compass needle points approximately toward the geographic South Pole. Earth’s magnetic poles wander over time, and approximately every hundred thousand years they rather suddenly change places.  So one day south will in fact be south! The orientation of the Sun’s magnetic field changes as well, but far more often. The Sun’s poles trade places about every 11 years, with one such change occurring in late 2013."

For example, the declination in Seattle is about 20°. Declination depends on one’s location on Earth. For this reason, some maps include the magnetic declination for the region they cover. ,The needles on most compasses today only rotate in the horizontal plane, but you can use a compass that also rotates vertically, called a dip needle, to estimate latitude, the north/south component of location. Near a magnetic pole, the needle points more vertically than at the equator. The diagram gives you a sense of how compasses with this feature worked.

The pickup consists of a coil looped around a permanent magnetic core. The magnet in the pickup magnetizes the guitar string. The magnetic field lines in the illustration are those of the magnetized string.,When the guitar player plucks a string, she makes it vibrate. The frequency of the string’s vibration determines the pitch of the note it produces.,As the string vibrates, it moves up and down near the pickup coil. You can see how this moves the magnetic field. The changes in magnetic field strength through the coil induce an emf that causes a current to flow in the coil. The current changes at the same frequency with which the string vibrates. ,The changing current flows to the amplifier, which increases the energy of the signal, and then transmits it to the speakers.

(If the field is not perpendicular, there will be less flux). ,Flux depends on the field strength at the surface. The closeness of the magnetic field lines indicates the strength of the magnetic field, so the more lines you see passing through a given surface, the greater the flux through that surface.,The amount of flux increases with surface area. We show a magnetic field. The orange lines represent the part of the field that is passing through the surface.  ,The equation shows how to calculate magnetic flux when the field is perpendicular to the surface area.  It equals the product of the magnetic field and the surface area.  Flux is represented by Φ, the Greek letter phi.   ,The unit for magnetic flux is the weber, which is equivalent to teslas multiplied by meters.

If they do not have the correct speed, they will be accelerated up or down, and will be trapped inside the selector. ,The velocity selector makes use of both an electric field and a magnetic field.

It can also be used to determine the relative amount of different particles in a sample, by directing particles of different masses to different regions of a recording plate, where they are counted. ,How does a mass spectrometer work? Before a substance is put into the mass spectrometer, it is vaporized and ionized. Ionizing means that one electron from every atom or molecule is removed. This leaves each particle − called an ion − with a net positive charge of a proton. When an ion enters the electric field shown at the bottom left of the sketch, the electric field accelerates it. ,When the moving particle enters the magnetic field, its velocity is perpendicular to the field. This means that it will move in a circle whose radius depends on the strength of the magnetic field as well as the particle’s mass, velocity, and charge. The experimenter controls the initial velocity by setting the strength of the electric field and can observe the radius. Using these factors, she can calculate the particle’s mass. "

You see a strip of gold with a current flowing through it in a magnetic field. The direction of the current is from left to right. The magnetic field points into the screen, so the current and the field are perpendicular. ,Hall knew the magnetic field would apply a force on the moving charges, forcing them to the top or bottom of the strip. We analyze what happens if the current carriers are positive. Their velocities will be in the direction indicated by the current arrow (that is, to the right). As you can confirm with the right-hand rule, the force on a positive particle is directed up. This causes the top of the strip to be positively charged and the bottom to be negatively charged.,For negative charge carriers, their velocity is in the direction opposite to the conventional current. Using the right-hand rule applied to negative charges, you see that the force on a negative charge carrier also points upward.

Lenz’s law enables you to determine the direction of the current caused by an induced emf. For instance, in the illustration, a magnetic field directed away from you is increasing in strength over time, meaning there is a change in magnetic flux through the area bounded by the wire loop. This will induce an emf that will cause a current to flow in the loop, but in which direction? ,To answer the question, we have to consider the magnetic field of the <b>induced</b> current. Lenz’s law says that the induced magnetic field will oppose the change in magnetic flux that caused it. Since the external field is increasing in this case, the magnetic field of the induced current must point in the direction opposite to the increasing external field.

(If not, we have a device that not only creates a current, but creates a force as well, which would be a source of perpetual, unlimited energy.) ,The force required to move the current-carrying wire at a constant velocity will be equal but opposite to the force applied by the external magnetic field on the wire.,We use the right-hand rule to determine the direction of the current.

Mutual induction occurs when a changing current in one circuit creates a current in a separate circuit by induction. We use the circuits in the upper diagram to explain how this occurs. When the switch in the left circuit closes, a current begins to flow in that circuit, which causes current to flow in the circuit on the right as well. Even though there is no battery or generator in the right-hand circuit, the light bulb lights up. This is an example of mutual induction. ,What causes the current in the second circuit? A current-carrying wire creates a magnetic field: The greater the current, the stronger the field. In the upper diagram, as current begins to flow through the circuit on the left, the associated magnetic field strength increases. You can see this in the animation. We pause the animation at a time when the current is still increasing. ,The magnetic field from the circuit on the left intersects the circuit on the right. As the magnetic field changes, the magnetic flux through the circuit on the right also changes. As Faraday’s law dictates, this induces an emf in the second circuit, which drives a current and lights up the bulb. ,In the second diagram, you see what happens when the current reaches a steady state. Since the current is no longer changing, there is no longer a <b>changing</b> magnetic field, and the magnetic flux passing through the circuit on the right is constant.

He used an ammeter to measure electric current in the wires. Faraday had always connected the battery in the first circuit before he connected an ammeter in the second, and he detected no current in the second circuit. However, on the morning of August 29, Faraday connected the ammeter first and then connected the battery.

For interference to occur, there are certain requirements for the waves.  To explain this, we use a light wave.  First, the waves typically must be of one frequency and wavelength. For light, this means monochromatic, which means of one color.,In addition, the waves must be coherent. Coherent wave sources can produce waves with all of the waves vibrating in phase, and they have fixed phase differences between the waves they generate.  A laser is a typical source of monochromatic, coherent light.  Coherent wave sources can produce interference patterns, like the pattern we showed earlier. ,An incoherent wave source has changing phase differences in the waves it produces. A typical light bulb is a classic example of a source of incoherent light.  The phase differences among the light waves emitted by a bulb vary randomly over time.  Waves from bulbs can interfere, but the random nature of their phase differences means that no stable interference pattern results."

First, interference experiments were important in demonstrating the wavelike property of light.  Second, the interference patterns produced by light provide striking examples of interference.,The photograph in the upper diagram shows a light interference pattern.  This pattern results when light from a single source passes through two slits and then reaches a viewing screen, as shown in the lower diagram.  The pattern suggests that light has properties we associate with waves, since water waves passing through slits could create a similar pattern. The result is the bands you see, with bright red light bands separated by dark bands. ,Why does light produce this interference pattern of light and dark bands? The English scientist Thomas Young was the first to explain the pattern, starting in 1801 with a series of experiments that demonstrated the wavelike nature of light.  ,Young shined light at a pair of barriers containing parallel slits to create the light interference pattern. The slits were small, with a width comparable to the wavelength of the light. The light traveled through two parallel slits, and the waves that came through each slit combined along the viewing screen.  The result was the interference pattern, similar to the one you see in the upper diagram.,When he saw the interference pattern, Young realized he had shown that light had wavelike properties.  He knew this because a similar setup could create an interference pattern with water waves.  "

For a change of pace from light, we now discuss how waves from two sound sources can combine to make a louder sound or no sound at all.   ,The diagrams show two loudspeakers that create identical sound waves, waves with the same amplitude and wavelength. The wave sources are in phase. In the upper diagram, the waves travel the same distance from the speakers to the listener’s ear. Peak meets peak and trough meets trough at her ear. This causes constructive interference, and she hears a louder sound in this case.,Since the path lengths are the same in our example of constructive interference, the difference in path length is zero.  We use <span class=\"Symbols\">∆</span><i>p</i> to represent the difference in path lengths.  Constructive interference would also result if the path length difference equaled one wavelength, two wavelengths, or any integer multiple of a wavelength.,In the bottom diagram, one speaker has been moved one-half the wavelength of the sound farther from the listener. This means that one speaker’s peak meets a trough from the other, and vice versa. ,The result is destructive interference. In principle, if the amplitudes of the waves at the listener’s ear are equal, she will experience silence as the waves cancel. This is the basis for noise-cancelling headphones.  The system analyzes the wavelengths of unwanted external sounds, and generates waves exactly out of phase with them to cancel them out. ,Destructive interference occurs when the path difference is half a wavelength, 3/2 wavelengths, and so on. The extra half wavelength difference causes peak to meet trough, and trough to meet peak."

Each point on the wave front is the source of vibrating, spherical wavelets. ,Huygens’ principle states that, at any time, the wave front is tangent to the front surface of the wavelets. The blue line of the wave front here is parallel to each wavelet’s leading edge − which is to say it is tangent to them. The wave front moves at the same speed as the wavelets."

Photolithography is used to create tiny circuits in computer components such as microprocessors and some forms of computer memory. Given how common computer circuits are, how they are manufactured is an area of ongoing research in industry.  Diffraction plays an important role in limiting the ability to manufacture smaller, more powerful circuits.  To explain why, we start by explaining how computer circuits are manufactured. ,The first step in creating a circuit is to create a mask by etching away parts of an opaque (nontransparent) material. The mask functions as a radiation stencil for the circuit pattern. The mask matches the circuits that a circuit designer wants created, just as we might use a stencil to create letters in a sign. ,The mask is placed in front of a light-sensitive layer of material, known as resist, that is on top of the chip material. Where radiation passes through the mask, it causes a chemical reaction in the light-sensitive resist material. The exposed regions are chemically developed and removed, forming a stencil. Then, metal can be deposited through the narrow openings in the resist to form the circuits.  A lift-off process then removes all of the undeveloped resist and unwanted metal. The design has been transferred from the reusable mask to the circuit that will ship as part of a computer, cell phone, or other electronic device. "

Designers want circuits closer to one another so that they can supply more computing power, or more memory capacity, in the same size component.  Denser circuits can also consume less power. ,What role does diffraction play in circuit density? Electromagnetic radiation, which includes light, diffracts after it passes through openings in the mask, which makes the transferred pattern larger than the openings in the mask. You see this happening here as radiation passes through one slit in the mask. ,As engineers design chips with greater circuit density, the circuits must be placed closer together. How close those circuits can be placed is limited in part by the diffraction of the radiation as it passes through the mask."

The bright and dark bands produced by a diffraction grating are very crisp, as shown in the upper diagram. We discuss why diffraction gratings produce interference patterns.  ,The bright bands, which are narrow enough to be called lines, occur where waves from every slit interfere constructively. The bands are very narrow because as the number of slits is increased, an increased amount of destructive interference occurs closer to the peaks. Here we show just a few slits in the barrier, but typical diffraction gratings have many hundreds of slits per millimeter.,When white light passes through (or reflects off of) a diffraction grating, the interference pattern shows the light broken up into its component wavelengths. You see this happening in this photo of light reflecting off of a CD. This effect occurs because the location of the bands depends on wavelength, so light coming from the grating at a certain angle may be constructive interference for, say, red light, but not for other colors.

We will discuss these various forms of radiation shortly.,We order the types of radiation by their frequencies, with the lowest frequency on the left. The energy (of a photon of electromagnetic radiation) also increases from left to right since a photon’s energy is proportional to its frequency. On the other hand, since the wavelength is inversely proportional to the frequency, it is smallest on the right, and increases as you move to the left. ,How were the various types of radiation discovered?  Much of the spectrum was discovered in the 19<sup class=\"\">th</sup> century.  In terms of frequencies adjacent to visible light, in 1800, Sir Frederick Herschel discovered infrared light just using a prism, and a clever experiment to show that thermometers were being heated by light he could not see. Ultraviolet light was discovered the next year taking advantage of the knowledge of chemical reactions. ,Later, in 1867, James Maxwell predicted that there should be light (radiation) with greater wavelength than infrared light, and in 1887, Heinrich Hertz produced radio waves.  Thanks to experiments with early cathode ray tubes, X-rays were discovered in 1895 when a scientist accidentally took a photograph with them. (The letter “x” initially referred to their unknown nature).  Finally, in 1900, the Frenchman Paul Villard was investigating the then new field of radioactivity when he observed gamma radiation."

AM radio stations announce their frequencies in kilohertz: “710 AM on your radio dial” means a frequency of 710 kHz. FM radio waves have higher frequencies and shorter wavelengths than AM radio waves. ,The government regulates who can use what frequencies. For instance, it wants to ensure a garage door opener does not interfere with a cellphone, or, someone’s wi-fi router doesn’t open the neighbor’s garage door. The frequencies used by radio stations were chosen in the first days of radio when the abilities to broadcast and receive transmissions were fairly limited. Some choices of “who” got what frequency are based on history − AM radio was developed before FM radio, so it got the lower frequencies. ,Cellphones use parts of the electromagnetic spectrum to communicate as well.  Higher frequencies can deliver more data − roughly speaking, the greater frequency allows more times per second for a signal to be encoded.  On the other hand, the higher frequencies do not travel through buildings as well, so the user may not receive an “invaluable” text or video stream as easily. ,Visible light has far higher frequencies than radio signals, ranging from over 400 trillion Hz for red light to almost 800 trillion Hz for violet light. Wavelengths of light are often expressed in nanometers: The wavelength of red light is around 650 nanometers. Everything you see in the world is brought to you by electromagnetic radiation − light − in this frequency range.  <a class='pjumpToVideo' href='javascript:void(0)' data-video='true' data-vref='wb_double_slit_white_concepts'>“White”</a> light consists of a mixture of all the visible light frequencies.

Although we may take it for granted now, measuring the speed of light required imagination and insight.  We dedicate a few sections to how early scientists determined that value. Many early scientists, such as René Descartes, thought the speed of light was infinite. Given that it moves at about 671 million miles per hour, it is easy to understand why they believed it moved at infinite speed.,Rather than accepting beliefs without proof, Galileo attempted to measure the speed of light. He had an assistant stand on a hill about a mile away with a light. Galileo flashed his light, and when his assistant saw the flash, he would immediately flash his light back. ,Galileo measured when he saw the returning flash. It was a simple but clever experiment, doomed to failure because of the lack of sophisticated equipment and the vast speed of light. ,The problem Galileo faced: If you divide the two-mile round-trip of light by the speed of light, it is clear that Galileo and his assistant lacked the reflexes, and timing equipment, to work with such a short time interval. Some quick math indicates the time interval would be about a hundred-thousandth of a second. "

Distance between Earth, Jupiter changes during year Moon appeared sooner when planets closer, later when farther apart Difference in times and distances used to calculate speed of light Where Galileo failed, a Danish astronomer, Ole Roemer, succeeded. He used a moon of Jupiter to measure the speed of light.,In the 17<sup class=\"\">th</sup> century, Roemer was studying Io, a moon of Jupiter.  He knew its orbit had a constant duration of about 1.77 days as it traveled around Jupiter, so he knew when it should appear in his telescope.,To his initial surprise, he was consistently wrong. During parts of the year it appeared earlier than he would expect, and during other parts, it would appear later.,Roemer found it difficult to convince his colleagues that the moon had such “timing” problems. To convince them, Roemer correctly predicted exactly how “off-schedule” the moon would be.   ,The important question was: Why did the moon appear sooner or later than simple calculations of its orbital period would predict? Roemer realized the difference was due to the changing distance between Earth and Jupiter as they orbit about the Sun. ,Roemer noted that Io appeared sooner when the planets were closer, and later when they were farther apart.  The differing distances between the planets meant that the sunlight reflected off of Io traveled different distances between that moon and Earth due to the changing distance between those bodies.,Using the differing distances and the “errors” in the time Io appeared, another astronomer, Christiaan Huygens, calculated the speed of light.  His value was about two-thirds the true speed of light, but it both showed that the speed of light was not infinite and provided a strong sense of what the true value is.  "

He set about measuring the wavelength of his radio signal while using his equipment to control the frequency.

He doubled that distance, and calculated the signal’s wavelength.  (If you remember that the wavelength of a radio signal is on the order of meters, this part of the experiment was not as difficult to conduct as it may sound.) ,Hertz could configure his transmitter so that he knew its broadcast frequency.  (We will skip the details of how he did this.)  With frequency and wavelength both known, now it was just multiplication.  Hertz multiplied the wavelength by frequency, and he had the speed of his radio broadcast.,Hertz’s experiment also provided evidence in another debate. His value for the speed for radio signals equaled the measured speed of light.  Although this similarity in speed was not proof, it was more support for the hypothesis that the light and radio signals were two forms of the same phenomenon, what we now call electromagnetic radiation."

Polarized light Light with electric fields that oscillate in one plane. Sunlight is unpolarized − the electric and magnetic fields that make it up are oriented in many directions.  Polaroid sunglasses take advantage of this phenomenon to reduce glare.  In this section, we explain what is meant by “unpolarized” and how the sunglasses work. ,In unpolarized light, such as sunlight, the fields of different waves oscillate in different planes. The electric and magnetic fields that make up these waves are all perpendicular to the direction of travel of the waves, but otherwise their directions are randomly oriented.  The upper diagram shows these planes randomly rotated about a line in the direction of the light’s travel. (In discussing polarized light, we use electric fields for our example, but the magnetic field would be described similarly.),In polarized light, the electric fields of all the waves oscillate in the same plane. We will show one way in which polarized light can be created. You see in the lower diagram a polarizing filter intercepting two waves of unpolarized light.  The filter will only allow through electric fields that are vertically oriented.  They are parallel to the filter’s transmission axis.  ,Waves that oscillate horizontally are absorbed and do not pass through the filter. The result is that the electric fields of all the waves oscillate in the same vertical plane. Sunglasses with polarizing lenses function as filters, similar to the filter described in this section.

Scattering explains why the sky is blue, and also explains why scattered light from the sky is polarized.,To explain scattering, we start with unpolarized light coming straight from the Sun, striking an electron of an atom in Earth’s atmosphere. The electric fields of the incoming waves shake the electron up and down and side to side.,The vibrating electrons then re-emit light waves at the original frequency. This absorption and re-emission of light is called scattering. Light is a transverse wave, so re-emitted waves may only be scattered in a direction perpendicular to the vibration of the electron. For example, electrons that are shaken up and down can only emit light in horizontal directions. Also, only electrons that oscillate side to side, in a horizontal plane, can re-emit a wave that travels downward to an observer on the ground.  This means that to a ground observer, scattered skylight is polarized, in roughly a north-south direction.,Not all wavelengths (colors) of light scatter equally.  The chance of scattering light of a certain wavelength is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the light’s wavelength. So, the shorter wavelengths, which we perceive as blue, scatter the most.  Their direction is more likely to be changed when they pass through the atmosphere, meaning blue light is scattered downward, turning the sky blue.  In contrast, at twilight when we look at the low Sun through a thick layer of atmosphere, it appears to be red because the violet and blue light have been scattered out of the beam, leaving the reddish shades behind to reach us."

Where there is atmosphere − near the surface of Earth − the astronaut sees a thin blue line due to the scattering of sunlight.  ,The Sun and the stars appear white from space. This illustration shows the full spectrum of visible light emitted by the Sun. None of it is scattered in the vacuum of space. Why does the Sun appear white, and not the yellow color you are more accustomed to seeing? ,Again, the lack of scattering is the answer. With no atmosphere to scatter the light and remove some of the blue light, the astronaut sees all the colors of the spectrum in the Sun’s disk, and she perceives the combination of all the colors as white.

Specular and diffuse reflection are two forms of reflection, with specular reflection the focus of our discussions in this chapter.    ,Mirrors and other smooth surfaces exhibit specular reflection, as does the ornament on the right side of the photograph. The right-hand ornament is extremely smooth and produces a specular reflection. Specular reflection means that the rays that are parallel and close together when they strike the ornament will all be moving in a new direction after they reflect, but they will still be parallel.  The law of reflection, a focus of this chapter, applies to surfaces that exhibit specular reflection.,If the reflecting surface is rough, diffuse reflection results. The ornament in the left side of the photograph provides an example of diffuse reflection. With a rough surface, neighboring incident rays will reflect in a variety of directions. Rays that are parallel and close together when they strike the surface will not be parallel after they reflect. ,Diffuse reflection is sometimes desirable.

Snell’s law would be applied twice in this situation, once at each boundary. ,A common example of multiple refraction is light passing through a window. Light refracts twice when it passes through a window at an angle. We show this in the lower illustration.  The first refraction occurs when light passes from the air to the glass.

The light traveling from the fish to the fisherman’s eyes refracts away from the normal when it passes from water into air.,Since the fisherman assumes that light moves in a straight line, he assumes the fish is higher in the water than it actually is. Refraction may cause him to throw his spear above the fish’s location in the water.,The fish’s view of the world is also affected by refraction. The lower illustration shows two light rays being refracted at the surface of the water, and coming down to the fish. The dotted lines show what the fish’s “cone of vision” would be if there were no refraction. Refraction increases the fish’s range of vision: He gets a wide-angle view of the world above. ,Photographs can be taken with a lens, called a fish-eye lens, which creates an effect similar to what a fish looking up out of the water sees.

If it did not, then waves would either “pile up” at the interface, or be destroyed. Neither occurs. You can confirm this in the animation by observing the frequency of the waves as they enter and exit the frame − it is the same. ,On the other hand, the wavelength does change, as you can observe in the illustration.  The peaks being closer to one another in the second material indicates a smaller wavelength. ,The equation we show states that the wavelength of light in a medium is inversely proportional to the index of refraction in the medium. For example, water has a larger index of refraction than air, which means light travels more slowly in water than in air. The wavelength of a light wave in water is less than its wavelength in air.

Differing wavelengths of light are refracted at different angles as they enter the drop. Violet, the shortest wavelength, refracts the most.  ,Light of all wavelengths reflects internally on the far inside surface of the drop and moves toward the left. The light refracts again as it leaves the drop, with the shorter wavelengths again being refracted the most. ,To explain how this dispersion is perceived as a rainbow, we use an observer facing the rainbow. This is shown in the lower diagram. ,The wavelength of the light he sees depends on the raindrop’s location. The red light reflected back from the uppermost portions of the rainbow reaches him, but the violet light from those raindrops passes by him. This means he sees a rainbow with red at its top.  ,On the other hand, the violet light reflected back from the lower portions reaches him, but not the red light. This means that he sees a rainbow with violet on the bottom.  The other colors can be explained in the same fashion since their wavelengths lie between the wavelengths of the colors discussed above."

The prisms are stacked one atop the other, base to base. The prisms form a model for a converging lens, since such lenses are thickest at their centers.,The upper and lower rays of light refract as they enter and exit the prisms.

The cornea is a transparent membrane forming the front surface of the eyeball. The ciliary muscle can change the curvature of the lens, causing its focal length to change. This allows the eye to focus objects at different distances at the same point behind the lens.,Notice the retina at the back of the eye.

Nearsightedness occurs when the image forms before the rays reach the retina. ,During laser eye surgery, a surgeon’s laser reshapes the cornea to correct for nearsightedness, reducing its curvature.

The principles of refraction and reflection are both used in designing telescopes. Here we consider refracting telescopes.,When most people think of telescopes, they think of magnification.  But an equally important function of telescopes is to increase the light that reaches the eye.  The amount of light that a lens can gather is proportional to the square of its diameter, which may be hundreds of times larger than that of the pupil of your eye. ,The eyepiece in a refracting telescope is used to magnify the real image produced by the objective lens, and make it comfortable to view. By placing the image far away, the eyepiece allows the eye to relax. ,The two lenses in a telescope are converging lenses. The image formed by the objective lens is located at its focal point, because typically the object is very far away, and so the incoming light rays are essentially parallel. The eyepiece magnifies this image. The system is designed so the final image is at infinity since the eye is most relaxed when viewing faraway objects. ,The objective lens in a refracting telescope produces an image that is inverted, smaller than the object, and real. The eyepiece uses that image as its object. The final image you see when looking through a telescope is the virtual image produced by the eyepiece. "

How was the old model of evenly distributed positive and negative charge proven to be wrong? The physicist Ernest Rutherford fired positively charged alpha particles at a thin gold foil target.  Alpha particles consist of two neutrons and two protons, which is the nucleus of a helium atom. ,If the positive charge and mass were distributed uniformly throughout each atom, Rutherford would have observed most of the particles passing straight through the foil or suffering a minimal change in direction. To his surprise, some of the particles changed their direction a large amount, and a small fraction of the particles even rebounded straight back. ,Rutherford drew the conclusion that the positive charge in an atom is tightly packed together in a nucleus, because only this dense concentration of charge and mass could explain his results.,Rutherford’s experiment was one of an important series that scientists conducted to determine a model of an atom. Because of the work of Rutherford and other scientists, today we know that the nucleus contains positively charged protons. Rutherford also demonstrated that the nucleus is relatively small. The radii of the electrons’ orbits are about 10,000 times greater than the size of the nucleus, meaning that an atom is more than 99% empty space."

Both neutrons and protons experience the strong force. ,The strong force and the electrostatic force are the two dominant forces within a nucleus.  Protons repel one another. There is no electrostatic force between protons and the neutral neutrons.  The strong force causes neutrons and protons to attract one another.  This accounts for the role of neutrons in the stability of the nucleus.  Neutrons provide an attractive force, but no repulsive force.  They play an important role in holding together the larger nuclei, such as those of uranium.,The final fundamental force is the nuclear weak force.  In certain circumstances, it transforms neutrons, turning them into protons, electrons, and antineutrinos. Neutrons are stable inside of most nuclei, but are unstable as free particles. The force is called the “weak force” because at ordinary temperatures, it is weak compared to the strong and electromagnetic forces.

For example, is it possible to have a silver atom with 47 protons and no neutrons? ,Only certain combinations of neutron number and atomic number will result in stable nuclei.

For instance, the ratio is 1 to 1 for light nuclei, but near <i>Z</i> = 80 the ratio is about 1.5 to 1. ,Why does the ratio increase? An excess of neutrons helps to dilute the proton concentration and contribute to stability. The neutrons increase the average distance between protons, reducing the average electrostatic force between them that tends to push them apart. In addition, neutrons, which are not affected by the electrostatic force, attract all other nucleons due to the strong nuclear force."

When light is conceived of as photons, brighter light means more photons, not larger-amplitude waves. ,As the light becomes more intense, more photons strike the metal, and more electrons fly off, with each photon ejecting an electron. Quantum theory explains these observations: brighter light (of high enough frequency) causes more electrons to leave a material, since more photons are striking it. However, the electrons each have about the same energy as before, even as the intensity of the incoming light is increased − there are just more of them.,Quantum theory also explains why light below a certain frequency does not cause electrons to be emitted.  Photons of a lower-frequency light, such as red, are not energetic enough to free electrons from the  metal’s atoms. Increasing the intensity of red light causes more photons to strike the metal but does not increase the energy of each photon. None are energetic enough to free even a single electron. ,To use a physical model, throwing a baseball at 0.1 m/s at a bowling pin might not knock it over, nor will repeated attempts at the same speed.

These are the lowest four discrete energy levels that the electron in a hydrogen atom can have. ,You may note that these values are negative. Physicists think of a hydrogen electron as being like a rock at the bottom of a well. It takes energy for this rock to escape from the well, and the closer it is to the bottom of the well, the more negative its energy is. Similarly, a hydrogen atom with its electron orbiting close to the nucleus has less energy than when the electron is farther away. ,We show the equation for calculating the change of energy as an electron moves from one orbit to another. As usual, it equals the difference between the final and initial energies.  For instance, if an atom absorbs a photon, the energy change will be positive as the electron moves to a larger orbit and the atom absorbs the photon’s energy. "

It is an implication of quantum theory. You are accustomed to the limitations in the accuracy of measurements you make, that are typically rooted in the limits of the equipment.  For example, an electronic stopwatch might only show the results to the nearest hundredth of a second. ,In contrast, Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is an absolute theoretical limit. The principle says that observations can only be so precise, no matter how good the equipment used to make the observation.  ,Heisenberg summed it up in a paper he wrote in 1927: “The more precisely the position is determined, the less precisely the momentum is known in this instant and vice versa.” A more precise measurement of position comes at the “cost” of less precision concerning momentum. In sum, there will always be some uncertainty if we try to fix both the position and momentum of a particle.  ,The equation sums it up: the product of the uncertainty in position and the uncertainty in momentum along the same direction must be greater than one-half of Planck’s constant. The equation quantifies what we have said:  the more we know about a particle’s position, the less we know about its associated momentum. A particle’s position and momentum must contain a certain minimum amount of uncertainty, because the wave-particle is spread out in space.  ,As with much of quantum physics, the difference between classical and quantum physics becomes apparent only when the particle is very small.  One way to “see” this is to consider how very, very small Planck’s constant is, on the order of 10<sup class=\"\">−34</sup> joule second.  Objects with, say, the momentum of a car would have a very, very, very small, virtually undiscernible amount of uncertainty in their position."

This is one example of matter having wave-like properties: The electrons exhibit interference and diffraction. ,When working with particles like these electrons, scientists face another challenge. They cannot determine in advance where a given electron will “land.” They can predict an overall pattern and state the probability that an electron will land in a given region, but they cannot state in advance that, say, the eighth electron will land in the middle of the second dark fringe. ,In the second diagram, you see the graph for the radial probability density of a hydrogen atom’s electron in its lowest energy state.  Like the landing spot of an individual electron passing through a slit, the location of the hydrogen atom’s electron can only be stated as a probability. ,The higher the probability density at a certain distance, the more likely the electron will be found near that distance from the center of the atom.  The graph of probability density shows the likelihood that a value will be within a certain interval. For a hydrogen electron in its lowest energy state, it is most likely to be found at a distance from the nucleus called the Bohr radius.  But if you observed an atom many times, you would find the electron at different locations, or distances, from the nucleus.

The state of the cat before opening the door is directly linked to the state of the radioactive material.  Quantum mechanics says that the cat is simultaneously in a state of being alive and in a state of being dead. But we believe from everyday experience that at any time, it must be either one or the other. A cat cannot be 50% alive . . . or can it? ,Schrödinger’s thought experiment is parallel to specifying the state of a particle that has yet to be measured.  Its properties can only be described as probabilities.  ,Schrödinger’s thought experiment also applies to what happens when a particle is observed.  Once the chamber is opened, the cat is either alive or dead, and the probabilities collapse and become an outcome.

The waves and peaks are <b>not</b> the path of motion of the electron, but rather are used to calculate the probability that the electron will be found at a given location. ,The wave shown in the upper diagram is a matter wave.  It is used to illustrate the case of an “impossible” orbit − one that cannot exist.  As the wave is wrapped around an orbit of this size, peak would meet trough, as the dashed blue lines indicate. The wave would interfere with itself and cancel − it would be a case of complete destructive interference. In essence, there is no wave, and there would be no electron. ,Physicists used this wave model of the electron and their understanding of angular momentum to determine possible orbital radii of electrons. The model, though effective at the time and useful even today as a visualization tool, has been improved and replaced by other models based on quantum physics. ,De Broglie also showed how the wavelength of a matter particle can be calculated.

If she and the professor compare notes afterward, they will find out they measured different intervals of time between the events.  ,Time passes more slowly in the professor’s reference frame than when measured by clocks in Katherine’s reference frame.

His measurement is the train car’s proper length. ,Now we consider the observations of Sara, the observer on the ground, who is watching the professor and the train car pass by at 80 percent of the speed of light.

Classical chemistry can be explained using a model of an atom that consists of electrons, protons, and neutrons.  The Standard Model is required to explain other aspects of science, such as sub-nuclear processes and processes occurring at extreme energies.,The Standard Model is the explanation scientists developed during the 1970s to explain matter and forces.  It has successfully explained a large number of experimental results in the field of particle physics, and accurately predicted a wide variety of phenomena. Over time and through many experiments by many physicists, the Standard Model has become established as a well-tested physics theory.,According to the Standard Model, everything around us is made up of 12 different matter particles.  Matter particles are either quarks or leptons.  Each group consists of six particles.  ,Matter particles are members of generations. The lightest and most stable particles make up the first generation, while the heavier and less stable particles belong to the second and third generations. All stable matter in the Universe is made from particles that belong to the first generation.  Heavier particles quickly decay to the next most stable level."

In other words, the rate of expansion has been <b>increasing</b>, rather than decreasing.

The Universe started small and expanded rapidly − a Big Bang. ,At the start of the Big Bang, the entire Universe occupied a space that was a few millimeters across, the size of a few grains of rice. Its temperature was unimaginably high. In a trillionth of a trillionth of a second, it expanded to a size comparable to the size of today’s Universe. The expansion continues.  In this process, space and time emerged. ,Why do scientists accept the Big Bang model?  One reason is consistent data that the Universe is expanding.  The astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that the light from distant galaxies exhibits a red shift − they are moving away from us, showing that the Universe is expanding.,Other evidence includes the large amount of helium present in the Universe.  Much more helium is present than can be explained by fusion within stars, which is creating it from hydrogen. The incredible temperatures present at the Big Bang quantitatively explain the large amounts of helium in our Universe. ,Further evidence includes the microwave background radiation that astronomers have observed.  Its temperature is consistent with the Big Bang model. Another piece of evidence is the presence of deuterium in the Universe.

Since 1930, particle accelerators have been the primary tool for experimental physicists studying the properties of the particles that form atoms. Accelerators have a complex system of electromagnetic fields that increase the speed of a particle.  Current accelerators can accelerate particles to very near the speed of light. ,Accelerators are often designed to create high-speed collisions.  Particles collide with other high-speed particles, or with a fixed target.  This causes particles to break into their components.  (This is why some people refer to accelerators as “atom smashers”.)  One scientist described the research as similar to determining the design of a television set by dropping televisions off the top of the Empire State Building.  This may sound crude, but the advancing technology of accelerators has provided evidence for many theories of particle physics. ,Accelerators come in two basic designs − linear (straight) or circular. The linear one at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (near Stanford University in California) is over 3 kilometers long. ,Accelerators can also have the shape of a circular ring.  In a circular accelerator, the particle can complete multiple laps before the collision. Its speed is increased during each lap, and its direction is controlled with increasingly stronger magnetic fields. ,Today’s circular accelerators are vast. The Large Hadron Collider (at the CERN research, on the Swiss-French border) has a diameter of about 8.5 kilometers. By contrast, the first circular accelerator had a diameter of about 10 cm, which is about 100,000 times smaller! "

Two issues facing humanity are limited supplies of water and the need for food in the poorest parts of the world.  For instance, droughts are worsening in parts of Africa, decreasing the supply of water and traditional sources of food. A lack of reliable water sources is a major constraint to an adequate food supply.,One potential solution is hydroponic farming.  With hydroponic farms, traditional soil is not used, but rather different media, or solely water.  This farming method allows for very efficient water use.  Conserving water is one of the two highest priorities of these systems.,One way to make hydroponic farming accessible is by installing farms within recycled truck containers.  These are the rectangular containers being pulled behind semis on the highway. ,Inside the containers, plants are grown on vertical racks, with their roots planted in water that is laced with nutrients.  LED lights supply the light necessary for photosynthesis. A single container farm produces the same amount of food as that produced by an acre of traditional farmland, while requiring just 5 to 10 gallons of water per day. ,The container also meets an important cultural need, allowing a community to be self-sustaining and use its own labor for at least some of its food supply, instead of relying on outside sources. This is the other highest priority of this approach to farming.  ,The containers may not be pretty, but their size allows for them to be placed in secluded locations to reduce their visual impact. Aesthetics is typically not a major priority of this approach to farming!"

For instance, one model of container farms requires about 100 kWh of power a day.,There are several reasons to consider solar power as the energy source. One, is the cultural desire for independence − there is no need to tie into a central electrical grid.  Two, electricity is expensive, especially in remote locations.  Three, solar power does not emit carbon dioxide, addressing an environmental concern.  Finally, safety: The solar power grid has no moving parts, so they do not pose the same safety concerns as a generator.,The priority of using solar power will vary based on the goals of the farmer.  For some, hydroponic farming is part of a green future, and solar power is an important part of that future.  It may also be an important part of the social desire for self-reliance. In remote locations, the lack of a connection to the electrical grid may be a constraint that requires solar or another off-the-grid energy solution.,For others, hydroponic farming may be a cost-effective way to farm, and solar power will be a lower priority. The initial investment for solar power may also be a constraint for some.  Safety typically is a minor concern. "

The solar system will convert solar power (sunlight) to electricity, which in turn will be converted to LED light, which plants will then convert to chemical energy via photosynthesis.,We approximate the cost of the required solar power.  This is only an estimate − a starting point to calculating a more accurate number.  We start with two pieces of information supplied by the manufacturer − the container farm system uses about 100 kWh of electrical energy each day and has its lights on for 16 hours.  To convert energy to power, we divide the 100 kWh by 16 to get 6,250 watts.,Next, we estimate how many solar panels are needed.  The single solar panel we are considering typically supplies a peak power of 250 watts.  We put one factor in the spreadsheet that reduces the power output − the conversion from DC to AC electricity. Dividing the farm’s power requirement by the power supplied by a panel, we find the number of panels (we round to an integer).  Then, using a current U.S. price for solar panels, we multiply quantity by price per panel to get the total cost of the panels.,The spreadsheet supplies a rough estimate of the costs − the panels are over $20,000. There are many ways to improve this estimate.  For example, we used the peak power of the panel − which requires peak sunlight.  Tools on the Internet allow you to create a more accurate, location-based estimate of the real average power a panel will supply.  We recall that the farm requires light (and power) 16 hours a day − longer than the sun typically is present.  Battery storage of electrical energy would be one option to keep the lights shining after the sun has gone down − but that would increase costs.  "

With solar panels, the return is saving the cost of paying a utility for electricity.  Over the years, the savings from those bills can pay back the initial cost of the panels. The question for this section is: How many years? A faster payback is better.<br /><br />We start with an estimate for power in one African country, Somalia.  Electrical energy costs about $0.18 per kilowatt hour.  Since the price is quoted in kilowatt hours, we calculate how many kilowatt hours the container farm will require per year.  Multiplying that energy requirement in kWh by the cost of electrical energy per kWh, we calculate the annual cost of electricity for the farm, if we had to buy it from the utility. ,We then divide the cost of the solar panels by the annual cost of electricity to determine how many years it will take to pay back the investment in solar panels.  This is one way to determine whether an investment is worth pursuing.  As a rough rule of thumb, an investment with a payback of fewer than 10 years might be viewed as a good one, while one taking longer than that might be viewed as an investment to avoid.  ,As we mentioned earlier, the cost of the solar power system might be higher than our estimate.  If so, this would increase the time required to pay for the system.  We also mentioned that one downside to solar power is that the lights are required to be on for about 16 hours/day, which is longer than the sun typically shines.  Using electricity from the utility, perhaps as a supplement to a battery system, is an option to address this shortcoming."

Energy in the form of heat also keeps us warm.<br /><br />As much energy as is now consumed, likely more will be consumed in the future: one group estimates a 40% increase by 2040. The source of much of today’s energy comes from oil, natural gas and coal.  The low cost of these energy sources is an essential criterion for their use. However, using these resources generates carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming.  So now the search for energy has the essential criteria not only of cost but also of impact on the environment. Society requires “clean” energy sources that do not release carbon dioxide or other damaging waste products.,Nuclear reactors are one source of energy that does not produce carbon dioxide.

The pressure of the resulting steam supplies the force to rotate turbine blades and generate electricity. In the early days of nuclear power, it was believed that plants would be so inexpensive to run that power might be free.  Unfortunately, this claim proved to be far from true. Nuclear power plants cost billions of dollars to construct.,In addition to its high initial cost, nuclear power has other shortcomings.  One is safety, because some plants have failed.  Plant failure results in the destructive release of radioactivity, as with the extensive damage surrounding the failed plants at Chernobyl and Fukushima.,Disposing of the radioactive waste from the plant poses environmental challenges, since the waste remains radioactive for thousands of years.  The plants, though most would judge them far from satisfying any aesthetic criteria, are typically placed in remote locations and are visible to few people, which makes this a minor criteria. However, nuclear operators struggle to convince society that the plants can meet the essential constraint of safety.,A nuclear power plant is expensive to build.  Proposed new plants have construction costs in the billions of dollars.  Two main factors are often calculated for nuclear plants.  One is the cost per kilowatt to build the plant − which is often $3,000 to $8,000 per kW. These kilowatts are supplied by the plant for its useful lifespan, which may range from 40 to 60 years.  ,Once the plant is built, then it must be supplied with fuel and operated by a staff.  These costs, plus paying off the cost of the plant, are used to calculate the cost per kilowatt hour that a customer pays.  Cost is an essential criterion for the selection of energy sources."

Critics of nuclear power counter that the plants often cost more than estimated, and last for less time than predicted.,These factors make costs difficult to estimate.  Assumptions required to estimate the price to consumers include the costs of plants (building and operating costs often run higher than anticipated), the cost of uranium fuel (which must be projected 40 or even 60 years in the future), how long a plant will last, and many other factors. ,Some of the most intense debate about nuclear plants concerns “externalities” − costs that are not directly related to the operators and customers of the plant.  Nuclear-power supporters argue that nuclear plants do not contribute to global warming and can be safely operated.  This is a benefit to all, not just to customers of the plant. It is an externality.,Critics point to a trade-off: the challenges of storing nuclear waste and the widespread environmental damage of plant failures.  Again, the damage of radioactive discharges spreads far beyond the plant and its customers, even across entire continents, and beyond. This cost too is an externality."

The resulting matter is called plasma. The resulting process reduces the total mass, but the energy released exactly accounts for the “lost” mass.  The sum of mass and the released energy’s mass equivalent remains constant.,Humans hope to harness the energy of fusion. Like fission, fusion is not a source of carbon emissions. Unlike fission, fusion does not release long-lived radioactive wastes. If scientists can design a functioning fusion system, it would seem to have no trade-offs between short- and long-term environmental concerns.,The challenge is to re-create the conditions inside a star, with its tremendous pressure and temperature, here on Earth.  No known material container can withstand the temperatures of plasma.   One answer is to use magnetic fields.

In addition to quantitative criteria such more rapid transportation, there is the qualitative goal of reducing the stress of the frequent sounds of airplanes overhead.,One way to address this problem is <b>not</b> to try to improve airplanes, but rather to think differently about satisfying the criteria of rapid transportation of people between major urban areas. A possible solution is a train − not the traditional train you may think of, but one using a new generation of train technology, operating on a system that differs significantly from a traditional “train track.” This proposed next generation of trains are called hyperloop trains.,One part of the design of hyperloop trains is the use of magnetic fields, but hyperloop trains are not unique here. Some trains in China, Korea and Japan do not directly contact the tracks, but ride above them, due to magnetic fields.  The fields use magnetic principles, in which placing similar poles near one another creates a repulsive force. ,The force of the field both levitates and propels the train. This design reduces friction. For all the technological sophistication, Newtonian physics explain the design − the force of friction of traditional train wheels opposes the force propelling the train, so by reducing friction, less propulsive force is required to accelerate the train or keep it moving at a constant velocity.

Many natural phenomena can be described with what is called a normal distribution and graphed with a normal curve, so understanding this type of curve proves useful. ,As an example of normally distributed data, imagine you toss a coin 32 times and record the number of times it comes up heads. You repeat this experiment thousands of times. The histogram shows, on its vertical axis, the percentage of times that a particular number of heads came up in the 32 tosses.  ,We draw a smooth curve that approximates the histogram. The shape of this graph is called a normal curve.,As you can see, a normal curve has a bell shape and is symmetric. All normal curves have this same shape, but some are spread broadly, while in others the data is more closely concentrated near the center.  For example, the heights of the hundreds of students at a school might be more widely spread than the heights of hundreds of varsity basketball players from across a city.,The numbers on the horizontal axis represent how far, in terms of standard deviations, the data points are from the mean. As we show, with this type of curve, about 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation, 34% on each side of the mean.,Another 27% of the data, composed of two 13.6% amounts of data on either side of the mean, falls between one and two standard deviations away from the mean, giving about 95% within two standard deviations."

To do this, we show how to approximate the area under a portion of the normal curve.  That area equals the probability of an outcome.,We use the outcome that occurs when eight coins are tossed many times − how many times they come up heads.  In this example, we are curious what the probability is that 1, 2 or 3 heads will occur. ,We draw a distribution curve for the probability of a particular number of 8 coins coming up heads.  We do this with bars. For example, the probability of 2 heads is a bit over 0.10 (10%). We then use the curve to show the normal nature of the data distribution.  ,To keep things simple, each bar has a base of 1.  Its height is the probability.  Its area equals the product of its base, 1, and its probability.,We want to calculate the probability of 1, 2, or 3 heads being the outcome of our coin-toss experiment.  We start by calculating the area of each rectangle.   For instance, the probability of 1 head is about 3%, the probability of 2 heads is 11%, and the probability of 3 heads is 22%.  These are the heights of the bars. We multiply each probability by 1, the width of the rectangle, to calculate the areas.,We sum the areas, with the result being 36%.  The probability of 1, 2 or 3 heads as the outcome is 36%. We approximated that probability by summing the relevant areas under the curve. "

As we did before manually, we calculate the area of rectangles to approximate the area under a curve.<br />We start with the area of one rectangle.  We will use an example of a rectangle that is between the points on the curve described by the cells B17 and B18.  ,To calculate the area of a rectangle, we average the values of the curve at two points, and multiply that by the width.  In other words, the equation for those points would be ((B17 + B18))/2 * B$2, with B$2 being the interval, and B17 and B18 two points on the curve.   ,We average the two values to get the average height of the curve at that point.

The graphs and this analysis emphasize that conclusion.  An outlier should result in a discussion. First, was some error made in recording data?  Second, perhaps this data set contains outliers, and we should respect that part of the data and not dismiss it.   For instance, if one were analyzing damage done to homes each year, the effects of an earthquake might result in an outlier data point.  ,Many natural phenomena can be modeled using a normal distribution.  However, not all data is normally distributed.,As an example, consider drawing a card from a deck of cards and replacing it.

The <i>r</i><sup class=\"\">2</sup> is about 0.001.  By visually inspecting the graph, you see that the points are far from the line.  It is possible that another equation type (such as exponential) might work better − or perhaps there simply is no correlation between the two variables being plotted. "

For instance, radioactive materials decay exponentially, with the amount of radioactive material repeatedly being cut in half after a fixed period of time, called the half-life of the material. After each additional half-life period, there is half as much radioactive material as before.,Radioactive iodine, I-131, is used to treat thyroid disease. It has a half-life of 8 days, which means that after 8 days, the amount of I-131 is half the original amount.

By “initial,” we mean the velocity when the ball first exits the cart, and the velocity components of the cart at that time. If your equipment does not have the capability of measuring vertical speeds, use descriptions such as “slow,” “medium,” “fast,” and “same as in previous trial.”\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tOne method to measure the constant horizontal velocity of the ball and the cart is for you to lay a meterstick parallel to the cart’s path and use a stopwatch to determine how long it takes the cart to cover a certain distance. Use a scientific calculator to divide the distance by the elapsed time.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tAnother method to measure the cart’s constant horizontal velocity is to attach a horizontal flag to the side of the cart.

The electron was assumed to be in a circular orbit about the proton, held there by electrostatic attraction. Bohr postulated that only certain orbits are allowed. The orbits are labeled by the “quantum number” n, which takes on positive integer values: n = 1, 2, 3, ... The n = 1 orbit (“the ground state”) has the lowest energy. The electron is usually found in the ground state and tends to move toward that state when in a higher energy state.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tBohr further postulated that an electron can change orbits only by absorbing or emitting a single photon, whose energy is equal to the energy difference between the two levels. (Energy is absorbed if the new orbit has higher energy than the original orbit, and energy is emitted if it has lower energy.)\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tWhen energy is emitted or absorbed, it appears in the form of electromagnetic energy, a single photon of light. The frequency or wavelength of the photon (i.e., the color of the light) is related to the energy.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tIn this lab, electrons are bumped up to higher energy levels by a high electric potential, and they cascade down to the ground level, emitting photos as they fall, producing an emission spectrum. Bohr concluded that the emission spectrum for different gases should be unique, consisting of a characteristic set of wavelengths. The particular “fingerprint” for each gas corresponds to the differences in energy between the various energy levels.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tAim your handheld visual spectroscope at a mini incandescent light bulb in a socket, powered by a battery. You will see a continuous spectrum. You will see the same thing if you look at a sunlight-illuminated cloud. NOTE: NEVER point your instrument directly at the sun! Permanent eye damage could result.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tNext, aim your handheld visual spectroscope at the gas discharge tube. Do you expect a continuous spectrum of emission lines, or only a handful of narrow emission lines? \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<div style= \"color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;\">Hypothesis</div></br>\r\n\tA hypothesis is a brief statement that describes what you expect your experiment to show.

In particular, he was first to explain the reason behind rainbows. Roger Bacon, a philosopher from the 13th century, guessed that the colors of a rainbow are due to the reflection and refraction of sunlight through raindrops, and Newton’s work later confirmed this hypothesis.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tWe now know that the wavelength of a visible electromagnetic wave determines the color that we perceive, but in Newton’s time, scientists believed that white light was colorless, and that the process of passing white light through a glass prism produced the color.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tNewton's experiments showed that all the colors already existed in the white light, and that \"corpuscles\" (particles) of light were spread out by the prism because particles with different colors traveled at different speeds through the glass.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tIn this lab, you will reproduce Newton’s experiments and refract white light with a prism, resolving it into its component colors: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo and Violet.

When we see light of a single wavelength, we perceive it as a pure color, such as red, green or violet. The light that comes from the Sun and from incandescent light bulbs, which we see as white light, is actually a mixture of many different wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tPrisms separate white light into its component wavelengths. Prisms disperse light because the index of refraction depends on the light’s wavelength, so the speed of light waves differs depending on the light’s color. This is called dispersion, or to be more specific, chromatic dispersion, since dispersion can also occur with non-visible electromagnetic radiation and mechanical waves as well. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<div style= \"color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;\">Steps in Experiment 1: Splitting White Light into its Component Colors</br></div>\r\n\t</br>\r\n\t<div class=\"pLabQASection\">\r\n\t<ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal;padding-left: 31px;line-height: 32px;\">\r\n\t\t<li style = \"padding-left:15px;\">Arrange the light source so that it shines through the collimating slit, so that you have a beam of white light.</li>\r\n\t\t<li style = \"padding-left:15px;\">Let the beam strike one of the triangular faces of the prism at an angle, i.e., not perpendicular to the glass surface.</li>\r\n\t\t<li style = \"padding-left:15px;\">Place the viewing screen at a distance from the prism so that a spectrum is projected onto it.</li>\r\n\t\t<li style = \"padding-left:15px;\">Draw a picture in your lab notebook with colored pencils.</li>\r\n\t\t</ol>\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<div style= \"color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;\"></br>Question</br></div></br>\r\n\tWhen white light hits a prism, the different wavelengths are refracted at different angles, resulting in a rainbow of colors.

However, if we wish to compare the activities of 2 samples that were not measured on the same shelf, it becomes necessary to measure the shelf ratio so that we can make an accurate comparison.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tIn this experiment, we explore the effect of distance upon the intensity of radiation and measure the shelf ratios of a sample holder. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<div style= \"color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;\">Steps in Experiment 3: Measuring Shelf Ratios</div></br>\r\n\t<div class=\"pLabQASection\">\r\n\t<ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal;padding-left: 31px;line-height: 32px;\" start=\"15\">\r\n\t\t<li style = \"padding-left:15px;\">Prepare the radiation counter as in the previous experiments.</li>\r\n\t\t<li style = \"padding-left:15px;\">Take a background count and record it.</li>\r\n\t\t<li style = \"padding-left:15px;\">Only one source at a time will be used in this experiment; make sure all others are kept far away from the radiation counter.</li>\r\n\t\t<li style = \"padding-left:15px;\">Place the radioactive sample on shelf #1, the highest shelf, which is closest to the detector.</li>\r\n\t\t<li style = \"padding-left:15px;\">Determine the number of counts per minute (cpm).

Using resonance and a tuning fork, you can determine both the frequency and wavelength of a sound wave.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tSince wave speed is the product of frequency and wavelength, you can determine the speed of sound in air.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tResonance tubes can be as simple as a plastic tube being dipped into water in a graduated cylinder, or as complicated as a dedicated expanding cardboard tube from a physics equipment supplier.

As your textbook discusses, reflecting waves interfere. If they interfere constructively, they get louder. An acoustic wave will constructively interfere with a closed air column at specific fractions of its wavelength, namely at 1/4, 3/4, and 5/4, etc. of its wavelength. When the air column’s length equals these fractions of the sound’s wavelength, the sound produced by a tuning fork held above such an air column will become louder. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pEquipmentContainer\" style=\"background-color: white ; font:14px arial; padding-left: 20px\">\r\n\t<div class=\"pExcersiseTitle\">Equipment</div>\r\n\t\t<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;margin-left: 40px;font:14px arial\">\r\n\t\t\t<li>Tuning forks</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Meterstick (metric ruler)</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Tall graduated cylinder, 50 cm or longer (or unmarked clear tube of that length)</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>PVC (or other pipe) with an inner diameter of at least 3 cm (if you are using a cylinder) and 50 cm or longer.

It is a game of timing and intellectual skill, not physical coordination. Throughout this lab, you will be able to shoot a ball on a ramp straight toward a series of circular slots, as shown in the picture below.\r\n\t<figure style=\"padding-top:20px;padding-bottom:10px;\">\r\n\t\t<img class=\"pExcersiseThumb\" src=\"course/labs/Using_one_dimensional_equations/assets/Ex_01_Intro to Skee-Ball_01.png\" style=\"width:70%;\"/>\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\t<figcaption style=\"font-family: AvenirNextLTPro-Demi;\">Exercise 1. Shoot ball with correct speed to drop into 50-point slot at 2.00 seconds.</figcaption>\r\n\t</figure>\r\n\tIn our game, the slots are initially closed. The ball will roll right over the top of them until a stated time when they will all open, allowing the ball to tumble down into one of them. In the first game, the slots will pop open 2.00 seconds after you shoot the ball.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tAs you can see, the slots have scores of 10, 20, 30 and 50. There is also a scale that tells you the positions of the slots in meters (m). The ball is initially at the zero meter position. If your ball is not positioned over any slot when they open, it will roll into the gutter and you will score negative 10 points.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tYou supply the ball with an initial velocity. There is no friction in the game. However, the ramp might be tilted, which could change the ball's velocity.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tEach game consists of five shots. A scoreboard tallies your progress and displays the number of shots remaining.\r\n\t<div class=\"pLabQASection\">\r\n\t\tGive it a try in the first simulation. When you open it, using the link below, you will see a Skee-Ball ramp.\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tThere is nothing to calculate here. Just play the game using trial and error. However, we will ask you a question at the end of this section about what you observed.\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tYour ball is next to a plunger that you use to set the ball's initial firing velocity. Use your mouse to click anywhere on this device and pull it back. The farther you pull, the greater the initial velocity the plunger supplies. The velocity in meters per second (m/s) you choose is displayed next to the plunger. Pressing the button marked FIRE will send your ball along the ramp at the initial velocity you have chosen.\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tYou can also pause the simulation with the PAUSE button and start a new game with the NEW GAME button.\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tYou can even shoot the Skee-Ball in the other direction, to the left, by dragging the plunger to the other side of the ball so that it points in the other direction. This will cause the ball to start with a negative velocity. The negative sign indicates the direction is toward the left. (This technique is necessary in some later exercises.)\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tUse trial and error as you would in a real arcade Skee-Ball game to get a feel for the course and to try to sink the ball in the 50-point slot. Observe the ball's motion after you fire it. Is it moving at a constant speed? Does it ever change direction? If you are not sure, assign the ball a small initial velocity and observe closely. If the ramp is tilted, the force of gravity will accelerate the ball, changing its speed, after you press FIRE.\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tWhen you are done playing, return here to answer a follow-up question.\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tClick here to enter the <span class=\"pExerciseButton\" data-href=\"course/virtual_labs/1_Using%20one-dimensional%20motion%20equations/1_Intro%20to%20Skee-Ball/\">Exercise 1 Simulation</span>\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"pLabQuestion\">\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pLabQNumber\">1.</div><div class=\"pLabQText\"> After you fired the ball, did the ball's speed or direction change? </div><div class=\"pLabQuestionArrow\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pLabAnswerWrapper\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<textarea class=\"pLabAnswerBox\" placeholder=\"Enter your answer here\"></textarea>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pLabSaveButton\" style=\"right: 40px;margin-top: -44px;\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pExerciseContainer\">\r\n\t<div class=\"pExcersiseTitle\">Exercise 2: Velocity</div>\r\n\tThis exercise features a different ramp than Exercise 1. You can get a good score using trial and error, but physics can help you master this game. Two key physics concepts you will need to apply are velocity and acceleration. In this exercise, we will explain velocity first, and then start to explain acceleration.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tVelocity states the speed and direction of the ball. The speedometer in a car tells you the car’s speed, but not its velocity, since it does not state direction. Sixty km/hr states a speed; 60 km/hr due east states a velocity.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tBelow is the equation for average velocity. Average velocity is defined as the change in position (Δ<i>x</i>) divided by the elapsed time (Δ<i>t</i>). In equation form, the average velocity of an object between two position points 1 and 2 is: \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<img src= \"course/labs/Using_one_dimensional_equations/assets/image100.gif\">\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tx<sub>1</sub> = position 1</br>\r\n\tx<sub>2</sub> = position 2</br>\r\n\tt<sub>1</sub> = time at position 1</br>\r\n\tt<sub>2</sub> = time at position 2 \r\n\t</br></br>\t\r\n\t\r\n\tThe change in position, Δ<i>x</i>, is the displacement. Displacement states both distance and direction. If the ball moves from a position of 1.0 meter to 3.0 meters along the <i>x</i> axis, the displacement is 3.0 m − 1.0 m, which equals 2.0 meters. When the ball moves to the left, its displacement is negative, since its final position is less than its initial position. The sign of displacement indicates its direction.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThe timer in the game tells you how much time has passed since the ball was fired. The elapsed time, Δ<i>t</i>, is how much time passes as the ball moves from an initial to final position. If you measure the displacement of the ball as it moves from <i>t</i> = 1.00 s to <i>t</i> = 3.00 s, then the elapsed time is 3.00 s − 1.00 s = 2.00 s.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tAs stated, average velocity is the displacement divided by the elapsed time. Example: Suppose the ball moves from 0.50 m to 2.00 m, during which time the clock ticks from 1.00 s to 3.00 s. The ball’s displacement then is 1.50 m, the elapsed time is 2.00 s, and the average velocity is 1.50 m / 2.00 s = 0.75 meters per second (m/s).\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tIn this game, we use positive numbers to indicate the ball is moving to the right, and negative numbers to indicate it is moving to the left. A ball that is moving at 3 m/s is moving at the same speed, but opposite direction, of a ball that is moving at −3 m/s. One is moving to the right, and the other to the left. If a ball moves from the position 3.0 m to 1.0 m in two seconds, its displacement is −2.0 m, and its average velocity is −1.0 m/s. The average velocity has the same direction (and sign) as the displacement.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tIn this simulation you will see a gauge below the plunger that displays the ball’s position as it moves along the ramp. You will also see a timer in the scoreboard that starts when you press FIRE. Using the position meter and the timer, you can determine the ball’s average velocity between any two points.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tAcceleration is the rate of change of the ball’s velocity. It is the change in velocity divided by the elapsed time. Your first challenge in this exercise is to determine at what rate the ball’s velocity changes as it moves along the ramp. In other words, you determine the ball’s acceleration. The acceleration may be zero, which means the velocity does not change.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tIn a follow-up exercise, you will use your findings to calculate the initial velocity that will sink a ball precisely in the 50-point slot. If the ball is not accelerating (its velocity is constant) then choosing an initial velocity for the ball is simpler. If the ball is accelerating (its velocity is changing) then it is more difficult to determine the correct initial velocity needed to sink the ball in the 50-point slot.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tBy recording data to determine a ball’s velocity twice as it moves, you can determine whether the ball’s velocity is constant or changing. Once you know whether the velocity is constant or changing, we will help you calculate how to sink the ball automatically into the 50-point slot. \r\n\t\r\n\t<div class=\"pLabQASection\">\r\n\t\tIn this first part of the exercise, there is no game and the slots do not open.

Another way of saying the velocity is constant is to say that the acceleration of the ball is zero.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tWhat if the acceleration is not zero?

In this exercise, you will determine the ball’s acceleration and then use your conclusions to master a different Skee-Ball ramp.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tIn this simulation, you will see a gauge that displays the ball’s instantaneous velocity, its velocity at a moment in time. Instantaneous velocity is calculated in the same fashion as average velocity, but using the displacement that occurs during a very, very small interval of elapsed time.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tAverage acceleration is defined as the change in instantaneous velocity (Δ<i>v</i>) divided by the elapsed time (Δ<i>t</i>).

Pick a reasonable value for the vertical component of velocity (again, the minimum is 35 m/s). You can calculate how long the cannonball will be in the air, and then use that time to determine the required horizontal velocity. There are two ways you can determine this flight time; either by considering the relationship between the initial and final velocities of the cannonball, or by considering the vertical velocity at the peak of the cannonball’s motion, and what percentage of the flight time it spends reaching the peak.

Jugglers must be able to throw a ball to a consistent height and judge precisely when and where it will land.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tA common way to learn to juggle is to start with one ball, throwing it so that it stays in the air for a consistent amount of <b>time</b>.\r\n\t</br>\r\n\t<figure style=\"padding-top:20px;padding-bottom:10px;\">\r\n\t\t<img class=\"pExcersiseThumb\" src=\"course/labs/Motion_in_two_dimensions_2/assets/Ex_05_Juggling to a specific height_1.png\" style=\"width:70%;\"/>\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\t<figcaption style=\"font-family: AvenirNextLTPro-Demi;\">Exercise 1.

This time is how long it takes the ball to rise to its peak and fall back to its initial height, where the juggler will catch it.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tWhen a ball is thrown upward, the force of gravity causes it to accelerate at a constant rate, slowing the ball as it rises and then speeding it up as it falls. While the ball is in the air, its acceleration is −9.80 m/s<sup>2</sup>. The magnitude of this acceleration is represented by g; the sign is negative because the acceleration is downward.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tA ball thrown upward has positive “y“, or vertical, velocity. The ball slows until its velocity is zero at the peak of its motion. After that, the ball continues to accelerate at −9.80 m/s<sup>2</sup>, which means it then has negative y velocity and is moving downward.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<div style=\"padding-left: 40px;\r\n    padding-right: 40px;\r\n    padding-bottom: 10px;\r\n    padding-top: 10px;\r\n    background: #cccccc;\r\n    margin-left: 20px;\r\n    width: 280px;\r\n    margin-bottom: 15px;\">\r\n\t\t<b><i>v</i><sub>f</sub> = <i>v</i><sub>i</sub> + <i>at</i>\r\n\t\t</br>\r\n\t\tΔ<i>y</i> = <i>v</i><sub>i</sub><i>t</i> + ½ <i>at</i><sup>2</sup>\r\n\t\t</br>\r\n\t\t<i>v</i><sub>f</sub><sup>2</sup> = <i>v</i><sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup> + 2<i>a</i>Δ<i>y</i>\r\n\t\t</br>\r\n\t\tΔ<i>y</i> = ½ (<i>v</i><sub>i</sub> + <i>v</i><sub>f</sub>)<i>t</i></b>\r\n\t\t</br>\r\n\t\t</br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t<i>a</i> = −9.80 m/s<sup>2</sup>\r\n\t\t</br>\r\n\t\tΔ<i>y</i> = vertical displacement\r\n\t\t</br>\r\n\t\t<i>v</i><sub>i</sub> = initial velocity\r\n\t\t</br>\r\n\t\t<i>v</i><sub>f</sub> = final velocity\r\n\t\t</br>\r\n\t\t<i>t</i> = elapsed time\r\n\t</div>\r\n\tThe equations shown in the box above describe this linear freefall motion.

Again, you will specify the initial y velocity, the initial x velocity, and the time delay between throws.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tAs before, you want to throw each ball into the air for 1.4 seconds, during which time each ball will move through a horizontal displacement of 0.70 meters.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tIn juggling three or more objects, there is a formula for calculating the correct time interval between throws so that your virtual juggling looks as polished as the real thing. First, determine the time it takes for a single ball to leave one hand, rise and fall to the other hand, and then rise and fall back to the starting hand (in other words, double the hang time). Second, divide this round trip time by the number of objects being juggled. The result is the desired time interval between throws.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tExample: Suppose you want to juggle three balls so that each one has a hang time of 2.0 seconds. Each ball would take 4.0 seconds to complete a round trip, a total of 2.0 seconds to go up from the first hand and down to the second, then another 2.0 seconds to make the return trip.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThe time delay between throws then would be 4.0 seconds divided by 3, which is 1 1/3 seconds. In other words, when juggling three balls, the second ball should be thrown a little after the first ball has passed the peak of its arc. (You will use this formula again later when attempting to juggle five chainsaws!)\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<div class=\"pLabQASection\">\r\n\t\tGive juggling three balls a try. Each ball should have a hang time of 1.4 seconds. Specify an initial y velocity and an initial x velocity so that each ball travels 0.70 m horizontally during its flight time. Also specify a time interval between throws using the input gauges in the control panel.\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tThen press GO and amaze your friends!\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tThe computer will automatically program the second hand, using your specified values, to throw the balls back to the beginning hand. If you get the time interval correct, a ball will be released just when the prior ball is starting to fall toward the other hand. Your juggling will look as smooth and polished as a professional’s.\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tOnce you have successfully juggled three balls, try juggling higher or lower by varying the initial y velocity. Here's something to think about: If you increase the initial y velocity, will the initial x velocity required for the juggler to catch the balls with the other hand increase, decrease or stay the same?

In physics and in car racing, direction matters, too. Most race tracks and roads have curves, and the driver must change the car’s direction to navigate around them. Velocity is a vector, and it reflects both speed and direction. 50 meters per second is speed, while 50 meters per second to the right is velocity.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tYour car has two gauges that show the x and y components of the velocity. These gauges will help you understand the relationship between speed, velocity and acceleration when your car is traveling around a curve.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tConsider the next race on the track shown below. This race begins the same as the first, with a straight Speed change zone.

When a car travels along a circular path, the acceleration due to its change in direction is called <b>centripetal acceleration</b>.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tYou know how to determine the amount of <b>linear acceleration</b>. It is the change in instantaneous velocity divided by change in time as an object moves in a straight line. It results from a change in the speed, the magnitude of velocity.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tCentripetal acceleration also is change in velocity divided by change in time but it results from the change in the direction of the velocity, not a change in magnitude.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<img src= \"course/labs/Circular_motion/assets/image55.gif\">\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t(Linear and centripetal acceleration can also occur simultaneously on a curve, for instance if the car speeds up or slows down along a curve, but that is a more advanced topic not covered in this lab.)\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tIn the diagram shown here, you see the velocity vector <b>v<sub>i</sub></b> for a car in a turn at an initial time, and then the velocity vector <b>v<sub>f</sub></b> at a later time.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tNote that the two vectors are the same length, indicating that the magnitude of velocity, or speed, is unchanged. The direction of the velocity vector clearly has changed.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tAcceleration can be determined by the change in velocity per unit time. The change in velocity, <b>Δv</b>, is determined by subtracting the <b>vi</b> vector from the <b>v<sub>f</sub></b> vector.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tIn the lower diagram we graphically show the subtraction that yields the change in the velocity vector, <b>Δv</b>.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tNote that the change in velocity (acceleration) points inward, toward the center of the circle. The centripetal acceleration vector always points to the center of the circle.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tWhat determines the amount of centripetal acceleration?\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tIn the next two exercises, you will investigate the two factors that determine the amount of centripetal acceleration. The first exercise explores the relationship between the tightness of a turn (its radius) and a car’s centripetal acceleration on that turn.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tLater, you will use the equation for centripetal acceleration to calculate how to beat the computer car every time!\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tConsider the next track, in which the cars navigate a course with two turns. The two turns are sections of circles with different radii, as you can see: \r\n\t</br>\r\n\t<figure style=\"padding-top:20px;padding-bottom:10px;\">\r\n\t\t<img class=\"pExcersiseThumb\" src=\"course/labs/Circular_motion/assets/Ex_04.png\" style=\"width:70%;\"/>\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\t<figcaption style=\"font-family: AvenirNextLTPro-Demi;\">Exercise 3.

In this race, the maximum centripetal acceleration you can attain before crashing is 3 g's, or 29.4 m/s<sup>2</sup>.

In this lab, you will apply this principle to fly a helicopter.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tFlying a helicopter is also an exercise in balancing forces. For example, when a helicopter is hovering motionless in the air, the sum of all the forces acting on the helicopter is zero. The force of gravity pulls down on the helicopter while an equal but opposite force generated by the spinning rotor blades pushes the helicopter up.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tWhen the net force acting on a body equals zero, it is in equilibrium. This does not necessarily mean it is stationary − a helicopter flying at a constant velocity is also in equilibrium, since it is not accelerating. Helicopter pilots place their craft in equilibrium both to hover, and to maintain a constant speed and direction.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tIn this lab, you are the pilot of a helicopter. Your mission is to guide the helicopter safely through a series of missions. You will do so by using your knowledge of <b>forces</b>, <b>Newton’s laws</b> and the <b>concept of equilibrium.</b>\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t(In this lab, we consider only translational − linear − motion. We ignore any torques which could cause the helicopter to have rotational acceleration. Torque and rotational motion are outside the scope of the lab.) \r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pExerciseContainer\">\r\n\t<div class=\"pExcersiseTitle\">Exercise 1: Going airborne</div>\r\n\t</br>\r\n\tIn the simulation for this first exercise, you can attempt some of the basic tasks required of a helicopter pilot. To do so, you control the <b>net</b> force upward on the helicopter. When the helicopter is in the air, the net force equals the positive lift force, which points up, plus its negative weight, which points down. (The lift force is caused by the interaction of the spinning blades with the air, and is used to propel the helicopter upward.) Throughout this lab, the upward direction is positive and the downward direction is negative. The net force, like all forces, is measured in newtons (N).\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tWhen the helicopter is in the air, you can set the net force to positive, negative, or zero values. The net force is negative when the magnitude of the helicopter’s lift force is less than its weight, except for when it is on the ground. When it is on the ground, there cannot be a negative net force because the normal force from the ground opposes the downward force of the helicopter’s weight and does not allow the helicopter to sink below the Earth’s surface.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<figure style=\"padding-top:20px;padding-bottom:10px;\">\r\n\t\t<img class=\"pExcersiseThumb\" src=\"course/labs/Force_mass_acceleration/assets/Ex_02_What is the mass of the helicopter_1.png\" style=\"width:70%;\"/>\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\t<figcaption style=\"font-family: AvenirNextLTPro-Demi;\">Exercise 1.

Next, attempt to have the helicopter reach a constant vertical velocity.

This law states that the sum of the forces on an object, which is the net force, equals the mass times the acceleration. Both force and acceleration are vectors, and the acceleration is in the same direction as the net force.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThe helicopter has the same controls as before. The acceleration gauge will prove highly useful in this exercise. Apply a net force of 2000 N to the helicopter and observe its acceleration.

Life is about to get a little more complicated.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tFirst, controlling the helicopter now takes a little more intellectual effort. You now set the lift force, and have to use that force to determine the net vertical force acting on the helicopter. As stated earlier, the lift is the upward force caused by the helicopter’s rotors. The weight of the helicopter pulls it down. Since you calculated the mass, you can determine the helicopter’s weight by multiplying its mass by <i>g</i>, 9.80 m/s<sup>2</sup>.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<img src= \"course/labs/Force_mass_acceleration/assets/image51.gif\">\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<b>Figure 1. The vertical forces acting on the helicopter</b>\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThe amount of weight equals mg, and the force is downward. We treat the lift force as positive since it is an upward force and the weight as negative since that force is downward. Figure 1 shows the vertical forces acting on the helicopter.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tSecond, and maybe we should have mentioned this first, your helicopter is plummeting toward the ground and will crash unless you do something about it. Bummer. Your co-pilot has fainted, but his words before passing out were: “If you can cause the helicopter to accelerate at 5.88 m/s<sup>2</sup>, we’re saved.” You trust him − he is a distinguished scientist, even if he does not react all that well to pressure. If you set that acceleration, the helicopter will land safely. If you err, it will crash into the ground, or fly off into space.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tTo solve the problem, you will have to know the helicopter’s mass. We hope you determined it correctly before, but since it is required to solve the problem, please click here to check your figure. If you made an error, it will cause problems for you in the rest of the lab.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<div class=\"pLabQASection\">\r\n\t\tThe helicopter starts 39.3 meters above the ground with a velocity of −21.5 m/s.

In this exercise, air resistance is now a factor in the simulation.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThe purpose of this exercise is to use your helicopter to determine how the force of air resistance varies with the speed of the helicopter. Does the force of air resistance increase as the helicopter’s speed increases? Does it decrease? Does it stay the same? If it changes, what is the mathematical relationship between the two?\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tTo answer these questions, you will fly the helicopter at different horizontal speeds. In the simulation, the helicopter will initially be hovering above the ground. Increase its thrust, and it will accelerate. However, with air resistance now acting on the helicopter, it will reach a particular velocity and stop accelerating.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tWhy does the helicopter cease to accelerate? For a given amount of thrust force, at a particular speed the force of air resistance balances the thrust force. This means there is no net force acting on the helicopter. The speed at which this occurs increases with the thrust force. This speed we will call terminal velocity (in principle, it should probably be called “terminal speed” since we are only considering magnitude, but terminal velocity is the more common term). The terminal velocity is a constant velocity at which the force of air resistance is equal to the force propelling an object. Here, you are experimenting with terminal velocity that occurs along the horizontal axis. Often terminal velocity is demonstrated with objects in free fall.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tYou can use the amount of thrust to measure how air resistance relates to speed. You are asked to graph the magnitude of the air resistance for at least three terminal helicopter speeds, and then interpret the graph to determine how air resistance relates to helicopter speed.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<div class=\"pLabQASection\">\r\n\t\tThere is no mission in this exercise other than collecting and interpreting data.\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tFly the helicopter by applying thrust using the left and right arrow keys, and wait until it is moving at a constant horizontal velocity. You can tell whether it is moving at a constant horizontal velocity by looking at the horizontal velocity or acceleration gauge. Note: Have some patience! It may take 10 or 20 seconds before your helicopter reaches a constant velocity.\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tUsing the helicopter’s gauges, determine the opposing force of air resistance for this helicopter speed. Remember, you can do this by relying on the fact that if the helicopter is moving at a constant horizontal velocity, then it is in equilibrium along that axis. Once you establish that the helicopter is in equilibrium, the horizontal thrust force of the helicopter is exactly balanced by the force of the air resistance. Write down the horizontal speed and the corresponding force of air resistance. Do this at least four times, noting your data each time.\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tFor best results, try a wide variety of thrust forces (one that is quite low, one that is quite high, and a couple in the middle, for example).\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tWhen you are done, <b>graph</b> the helicopter’s velocity versus the force of air resistance on a separate sheet of paper. State the velocity, in m/s, on the y axis and the force of air resistance, in newtons, on the x axis.\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tThen, return here to answer some follow-up questions.\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tClick here to enter the <span class=\"pExerciseButton\" data-href=\"course/virtual_labs/5_Force,%20mass%20and%20acceleration/4_Air%20resistance/\">Exercise 4 Simulation</span>\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"pLabQuestion\">\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pLabQNumber\"></div><div class=\"pLabQText\"> Complete the table below</div><div class=\"pLabQuestionArrow\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pLabAnswerWrapper\" style=\"height:220px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<table class=\"pLabAnswerTable\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<td style= \"width:100px\"> </td><td>Speed</td><td>Force</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Data point 1</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<td><input type=\"text\" class=\"pLabAnswerInput\"/>m/s</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<td><input type=\"text\" class=\"pLabAnswerInput\"/>N</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Data point 2</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<td><input type=\"text\" class=\"pLabAnswerInput\"/>m/s</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<td><input type=\"text\" class=\"pLabAnswerInput\"/>N</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Data point 3</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<td><input type=\"text\" class=\"pLabAnswerInput\"/>m/s</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<td><input type=\"text\" class=\"pLabAnswerInput\"/>N</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Data point 4</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<td><input type=\"text\" class=\"pLabAnswerInput\"/>m/s</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<td><input type=\"text\" class=\"pLabAnswerInput\"/>N</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t</table>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pLabSaveButton\" style=\"right:405px;margin-top: 162px;\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"pLabQuestion\">\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pLabQNumber\">6.</div><div class=\"pLabQText\"> Look at your data.

Objectscan exert forces on other objects without direct contact. The gravitational force is one of the fundamental forces in the universe, and we would all be flying off the surface of the Earth without it.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThe topic of gravity has played a starring role in some of the most famous tales in the history of physics. Galileo Galilei was studying the acceleration due to the Earth’s gravity when he dropped two balls from the Leaning Tower of Pisa. A theory to explain the force of gravity came to Isaac Newton shortly after an apple fell from a tree and knocked him in the head. Although historians doubt whether these events actually occurred, the stories have come to symbolize how a simple experiment or a sudden moment of insight can lead to important and lasting scientific progress.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tAs with other forces, a gravitational force has both strength (magnitude) and direction. The amount of gravitational force between two objects depends on the amount of their masses and on the distance between them.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pExerciseContainer\">\r\n\t<div class=\"pExcersiseTitle\">Exercise 1: Gravitational force and mass</div>\r\n\t</br>\r\n\tIn this exercise, you will make measurements of the gravitational attraction between two spheres to see how the force of gravity relates to the mass of an object.

They use the model of an ideal gas to relate important properties of a gas, such as its temperature and the kinetic energy of the molecules that make it up. The “ideal gas law” relates a gas’s pressure, its volume, the number of particles in the gas, and its temperature.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tWhat is an ideal gas? An ideal gas consists of a large number of atoms or molecules. (We will from now on just refer to the particles that make up the gas as “molecules” for simplicity’s sake, although there are monatomic gases like neon.) They are separated on average by distances large relative to the size of a molecule. They move at high speeds and collide frequently.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tUsing descriptions like “large” and “frequently” does not convey the nature of gases as well as specific numbers. Consider nitrogen molecules (N<sub>2</sub>), the most common molecule in our atmosphere. In one cubic meter of nitrogen molecules at standard pressure and temperature, there are 2.69 × 10<sup>25</sup>molecules. They occupy just 0.07% of the space and move at an average speed of 454 m/s. The molecules run into one another a lot: There are 9.9 × 10<sup>34</sup> collisions each second in that space.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThe molecules collide elastically both with each other and the container walls. The molecules only exert forces on one another when they collide; other longer range forces are negligible. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tEach molecule can be considered as a small, hard sphere. In elastic collisions, overall kinetic energy and momentum are both conserved. The velocities of the molecules change after a collision, but the total momentum and kinetic energy of the molecules remain the same. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThe walls of the container are assumed to be rigid. When a molecule collides with a wall, its speed does not change although its velocity does (because its direction changed). Standard Newtonian physics can be used to analyze the collisions of the molecules with each other and with the walls of the container. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tWe use a pool table and pool balls to illustrate and model an ideal gas. The pool balls collide elastically, like the molecules in an ideal gas, and they only interact with one another via collisions. We ignore other forces like friction and air resistance.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tIn this lab, you conduct a series of experiments. You can answer questions such as: How does the speed of individual gas molecules vary over time? What happens to the pressure of a gas if you reduce the size of the container? What happens if you add more molecules?\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<span style='font-weight:bold;line-height: 22px;'>\r\n\t\tYou will learn:\r\n\t\t<ul style='list-style-type:disc;padding-left: 18px;'>\r\n\t\t\t<li><i>What happens to molecules that are allowed to collide under ideal conditions</i></li>\r\n\t\t\t<li><i>How a distribution curve describes the behavior of ideal gas molecules</i></li>\r\n\t\t\t<li><i>The ideal gas law (the relationship between pressure, volume, temperature and the number of molecules in a quantity of gas)</i></li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pExerciseContainer\">\r\n\t<div class=\"pExcersiseTitle\">Exercise 1: Simulating an ideal gas</div>\r\n\t</br>\r\n\tThis exercise simulates how molecules interact under ideal conditions.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThe simulation, pictured below, is a container with eight balls, each of which represents a gas molecule. All the molecules in the simulation are the same; they have identical masses and sizes.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<figure style=\"padding-top:20px;padding-bottom:10px;\">\r\n\t\t<img class=\"pExcersiseThumb\" src=\"course/labs/Thermodynamics_and_states_of_matter/assets/Simulating an ideal gas.png\" style=\"width:70%;\"/>\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\t<figcaption style=\"font-family: AvenirNextLTPro-Demi;\">Exercise 1. Simulating an ideal gas.</figcaption>\r\n\t</figure>\r\n\t</br>\r\n\tWhen you start the simulation, the molecules will be moving at the same speed but in randomly set directions. They will move around the container, bouncing off the walls and each other.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tAll collisions − between two molecules or between a molecule and a wall − are perfectly elastic, meaning there is no kinetic energy lost in the collisions. A molecule will rebound off a wall with exactly the same speed as it had coming in. When two molecules collide, some kinetic energy may transfer from one molecule to another, but the sum of their kinetic energies remains the same. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThere is no friction, and no other forces come into play.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tYou can think of the molecules you will see in the simulation as magnified and moving in slow motion. While the simulation accurately models the behavior of an ideal gas, it is important to keep in mind that a typical gas found in nature consists of billions or trillions of particles, each moving at extraordinarily high speeds. A single breath of fresh air at typical room temperature and pressure contains approximately 4.3×1022 molecules!\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThis simulation displays the speed of each molecule. The speed readings are presented in meters per second, and these are the values you should use in any calculations. However, the actual movement of the molecules on screen has been slowed by roughly a billion; it would be impossible to see the molecules if they were shown at their actual size and speeds.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tBefore you start the simulation, think about the setup and imagine what will happen once the molecules start moving and colliding with one another and the edges of the container.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<div class=\"pLabQASection\">\r\n\t\t<div class=\"pLabQuestion\">\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pLabQNumber\">1.</div><div class=\"pLabQText\"> The molecules start out with identical speeds.

Why? Imagine you are a gas molecule traveling due north at 150 meters per second, and another molecule traveling in a different direction collides with you. Your direction and speed afterwards may not be the same as they were before. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThe speed of an ideal gas molecule changes many times every second. Recording the data continuously is time-consuming, and displaying it numerically would be overwhelming. The simulation below includes a graphing feature to chart the pattern of speeds of the molecules, which makes it simpler to see patterns. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThe graph displays ranges of molecular speed on the x axis, and the percentage of molecules traveling in those speed ranges on the y axis. The simulation updates the speeds of the molecules about 20 times each second, and displays the cumulative data recorded from the beginning of the simulation. The software program is creating what is called a distribution curve; it shows the percentage of molecules moving at various speed ranges. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThis simulation contains an ideal gas similar to the one in Exercise 1. We have increased the number of gas molecules to 50.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThe gas molecules all start at the same speed, 240 m/s, but again, their initial directions are random.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tAgain, though the speeds presented are in m/s, the motion on the screen is slowed by a factor of one billion.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tEvery time there is a collision between gas molecules, the graph updates the data for those molecules. In this fashion, the graph will present a picture of patterns in the molecular speeds.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t\r\n\t<div class=\"pLabQASection\">\r\n\t\tIn the simulation, press GO on the control panel to start the molecules moving.\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tObserve the graph in the simulation window.

(If you have a chance, let it run for thirty minutes or so for the “perfect” graph.)\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tAs before, you can freeze the action by pressing PAUSE.

The likelihood of N number of tails is the same as the likelihood for N number of heads, so such a graph would be symmetric about the “500 heads, 500 tails”.\r\n\t\t\t</br></br> Is the graph of the molecules’ speeds symmetrical?

It is named after James Clerk Maxwell, a British physicist in the 19th century whose achievements include developing statistical methods for modeling gases.\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tOne characteristic of this curve you may have noted is the long “tail” to the right. Some molecules are moving quite rapidly compared to the average speed of the gas. This property of a gas (and other substances) is quite important.\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tThis type of distribution can be used to explain other phenomena, like evaporation in a liquid. The speed of the water molecules is distributed, and those moving fast enough will evaporate. Not all the molecules evaporate at the same time because their speeds are not the same. Evaporation is a cooling process, as you no doubt have experienced after stepping out of the shower, because the molecules with the greatest speed (and KE) leave, reducing the average KE of the molecules that remain behind.\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pExerciseContainer\">\r\n\t<div class=\"pExcersiseTitle\">Exercise 3: Temperature and average molecular speed</div>\r\n\t</br>\r\n\tYou now will study the “macroscopic” properties of a gas; these are overall properties of a quantity of gas, such as its pressure or volume, as opposed to “microscopic” properties, such as the speed of its individual molecules. To start this transition, you will explore how changing the temperature of a gas affects the speed of its molecules. You will observe the relationship qualitatively, and also develop a mathematical relationship for how temperature changes affect molecular speed.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tAfter this exercise, you will experiment with the relationship between the average speed of a molecule and the pressure of the gas.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<div class=\"pLabQASection\">\r\n\t\tStart the simulation by pressing GO. Then change the temperature of the gas by clicking the up or down arrows on the temperature dial in the control panel. The temperature is displayed in kelvins (K) and ranges from 100 K to 600 K.\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tThe simulation will calculate the average speed of the molecules (v<sub>avg</sub>) and display it in a gauge on the control panel.\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tThe purpose of the exercise is to determine the relationship between the temperature and average molecular speed in an ideal gas. Pick a temperature and record the average speed of the gas molecules. Then change the temperature value and record the new average speed. Repeat this at least five times over a wide range of temperatures; you want enough data to determine the relationship between the two variables.\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tYou will note that the output gauge for the average speed shows that this value fluctuates even while the temperature is held constant. This is not a bug; it accurately reflects the average speed. In terms of recording data, look at the gauge and make an approximation of what the average speed is for a given temperature. The average speed varies on the order of 5 to 10%. This is a good reason to record several data points. Pressing PAUSE enables you to read the data more easily. Data in real world experiments may have error or “noise”, and this computer simulation is no different. We have deliberately avoided creating “ideal” data, in order to expose you to the realities of laboratory work.\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\t(Why does the average speed vary? One answer is: What principle of physics says it cannot? Earlier questions in this lab asked you to average both the KE (proportional to the speed squared) and the speed. You might ponder the data and conclusions you reach there in order to understand why the average speed changes.

This is the subject of Exercise 7.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tExercise 4 asks this question: What happens, if anything, to the pressure of a gas when its temperature increases? The other properties of the gas, its volume and number of molecules, are held constant so you can focus on this relationship.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tUse the ideal gas simulator to find out.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<div class=\"pLabQASection\">\r\n\t\tYou can set the temperature of the gas as you did before, by clicking the up or down arrows on the temperature dial in the control panel. The temperature ranges from 100 K to 600 K.\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tA separate gauge displays the gas pressure, in pascals (Pa). Inside of a 3-D box, the average force per unit area exerted by bouncing molecules on the walls is called <b>pressure</b>. Generally, the more often molecules collide with the walls, the greater the pressure. The simulation measures pressure by calculating the force with which the molecules collide with the walls of the container, and then dividing by the surface area of the walls.\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\t(NOTE: You can only see two dimensions in the simulation. An unseen third dimension is present in the simulation to create the volume shown in the output gauge.)\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tThe purpose of this exercise is to find the relationship between the temperature and pressure of an ideal gas, when other variables (such as volume) are held constant.\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tStart the simulation by pressing GO, and then record the temperature and pressure of the gas. Change the temperature and record another pair of data points. Repeat this at least five times until you have enough data to graph the relationship between gas temperature and pressure.\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tIn the graph, place pressure P in pascals (Pa) on the y axis, and temperature T, in kelvins (K), on the x axis.\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tYou can use the PAUSE button to freeze the simulation at any point to more easily read the pressure gauge. Again, you will see fluctuations in the pressure at a given temperature. This occurs for the same reason that the average speed fluctuated. These fluctuations are smaller at lower temperatures.

The electric force is one of the fundamental forces in the universe, and examples of it may be found literally everywhere, from televisions where electrically charged plates steer beams of electrons to strike the screen, to the interior of atoms where the electric attraction between the positive nucleus and the negative electrons helps to hold them together.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tAs with other forces, an electric force has both strength (magnitude) and direction. The amount of electrostatic force between two charged particles depends on the strength of the charges and on the distance between them, and the direction of the force is determined by their positions and the sign of their charges.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tAfter your initial work on charges, it will be time for some play. You will take a trip to a miniature electric golf course.\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"pExerciseContainer\">\r\n\t<div class=\"pExcersiseTitle\">Exercise 1: Sign and direction of force</div>\r\n\t</br>\r\n\tYou will start by using a simulation with two spheres that are electrically charged in order to see how the direction of the force between two charged particles depends on the signs of the charges. The basic setup of the simulation is shown below.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tAs you can see, the charged spheres are different colors. The force the blue charged sphere exerts on the orange charged sphere is shown with a blue arrow. The force the orange sphere exerts on the blue sphere is shown with an orange arrow. The arrow points in the direction of the force. The longer the arrow, the greater the amount of the force.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tYou can see that the charged spheres repel each other. By repel, we mean the forces push them apart.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<figure style=\"padding-top:20px;padding-bottom:10px;\">\r\n\t\t<img class=\"pExcersiseThumb\" src=\"course/labs/Force_between_charged_particles/assets/Sign and direction of force.png\" style=\"width:70%;\"/>\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\t<figcaption style=\"font-family: AvenirNextLTPro-Demi;\">Exercise 1.

After you launch it, set the amount of charge by using the up-down arrows next to the numbers. The amount of charge is a multiple of 10-12 coulombs, 0.00000000001 coulombs. Even though this seems like a small amount of charge, it would take millions of electrons or protons to create the amount of charge used in these simulations. \r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tBoth charges start at zero, so if you press the up arrow at first, you create a positive number, and a positive charge. If you press the down arrow at first, you will have a negative number, which means you have created a negative charge.\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tExample: If you click <b>up</b> to a charge equaling “4,” then you have loaded the sphere with a total <b>positive</b> charge of 4.0×10-12 coulombs.

Did you conclude that the electric force should get weaker with distance? Perhaps you thought about what would happen if the electric force got <b>stronger</b> with distance. It would be a strange universe indeed − for example, the flight paths of electrons in your TV set would be affected more by your neighbor’s TV set than your own! Or, in this case, two charges on opposite sides of the galaxy would exert incredible amounts of force on one another.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tAlternatively, you may have turned to your everyday experience to answer the question. For example, when you take out two laundry items fresh from the dryer that want to stick together (the dreaded “static cling”), separating the two pieces reduces their attractive force.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tIn this exercise, you will investigate what happens to the amount of force when the amount of one change changes. For example, what happens if the amount of one charge doubles? Triples?\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tTo do so, you will proceed in a fashion very similar to the one you used to determine the relationship of force and distance. You will set the charges, record the value for the force, and then change the value of one charge, and again record the force. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tTo do this, you will change the value of one charge at a time. The data table below assumes you hold one charge constant and vary the other. You will record the data, and then answer the same question as before. Is the force proportional to q1? Or is the force inversely proportional, and so on.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<figure style=\"padding-top:20px;padding-bottom:10px;\">\r\n\t\t<img class=\"pExcersiseThumb\" src=\"course/labs/Force_between_charged_particles/assets/How the charge values affect the force.png\" style=\"width:70%;\"/>\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\t<figcaption style=\"font-family: AvenirNextLTPro-Demi;\">Exercise 3.

The greater the force, the faster the ball moves initially. By the end, you may be so skilled at calibrating this force that you can score a hole-in-one every time! \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThe putter is unique − it is a massive wand that you load with charge. You load the club head with positively charged protons or negatively-charged electrons. A proton has a charge of <b>positive</b> 1.6 x 10<sup>−19</sup> coulombs. An electron has a charge of <b>negative</b> 1.6×10<sup>−19</sup> coulombs. The golf ball has a net charge equal to the charge of one proton. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<figure style=\"padding-top:20px;padding-bottom:10px;\">\r\n\t\t<img class=\"pExcersiseThumb\" src=\"course/labs/Force_between_charged_particles/assets/Ex_05_Electric golf − the practice green_1.png\" style=\"width:70%;\"/>\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\t<figcaption style=\"font-family: AvenirNextLTPro-Demi;\">Exercise 4. Putt the charged golf ball into the cup using your charged putter.</figcaption>\r\n\t</figure>\r\n\tAs you load the very massive club head with charge, the putter and ball immediately exert forces on each other. (The vector arrow shown above indicates the direction and magnitude of the force of the putter on the ball; we do not display the equal but opposite force on the putter.) The ball will stay “frozen” in place until you push the PUTT button in the simulation. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThis golf course has friction, which causes the ball to slow and roll to a stop. When you push PUTT, the ball will move across the course. Its acceleration (and velocity) will depend on the amount and direction of the net force on it. After the ball stops moving, the ball again is frozen in place, which allows you to set up for your next shot. Otherwise, the ball would begin to move as you increased the charge in the putter, or moved the putter closer to the ball. You press PUTT when you are ready to take your next shot. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\r\n\t<div class=\"pLabQASection\">\r\n\t\tThis first exercise is just for practice. Do not worry about exactly how much force the putter exerts on the golf ball. Use trial and error to sink the ball. You will make more precise calculations later.\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tOn this first practice green, the putter is positioned a fixed distance from the ball. Your challenge is to get the ball to move across the green − hopefully into the cup − by loading the putter with charges. You will only get one putt, so if the putt doesn’t drop, press RESET and try again.

Trust us. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tIf the initial force is lower than this figure, the ball will stop short of the hole. If the initial force is higher, the ball will overshoot the hole and fall into the water trap, taking your hopes and dreams with it. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThe challenge is to use Coulomb’s law and program the putter to impart exactly the right amount of initial force on the ball. You set both the charge on the putter and the distance between the charged putter and the charged ball.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tHINT: It may be easier to pick a value for the amount of charge, and then calculate the distance.

You are playing solely for pride, and love of physics - there are no monetary rewards. In fact, there will even be a charge to play (1.6×10<sup>−19</sup> coulombs, to be exact). Please mail in one proton to us. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tAs before, you set the amount of charge on the putter and you can move the charged putter closer to or farther away from the charged proton ball. In addition, you can now rotate the golfer to aim the ball. A gauge in the control panel displays how far the putter is from the ball. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tFor an extra challenge, some of the courses are dotted with clumps of positive and negative charges, marked with plus signs or minus signs. The amount of charge on the obstacles is indicated. You will find that your proton ball has a very strong reaction to these clumps of charges, sometimes from a great distance away! \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tAll the obstacles are point charges. The shape of an obstacle − like a sand trap − is intended to give you a visual image only. The amount of charge in an obstacle is quantified as a multiple of e, the elementary charge. The elementary charge equals 1.6×10<sup>−19</sup> C, the magnitude of charge of a proton or an electron. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThere also are hills. Again, the outline of the hill is just a visual metaphor, not a precise depiction of the forces. When you press GO, the ball will be released, and propelled from the charged putter to move under the influence of friction, the putter, and any other electric forces that act on it. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<figure style=\"padding-top:20px;padding-bottom:10px;\">\r\n\t\t<img class=\"pExcersiseThumb\" src=\"course/labs/Force_between_charged_particles/assets/Sign and direction of force(Hole 1).png\" style=\"width:70%;\"/>\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\t<figcaption style=\"font-family: AvenirNextLTPro-Demi;\">Exercise 6. Putt the charged ball into the cup using your charged putter − but watch out for the sand traps and the hills!</figcaption>\r\n\t</figure>\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tOnce the ball comes to a stop, it is held in place so you can click and drag the putter over to the ball for your next stroke. Position the putter, enter a new value for its charge if you wish, then press PUTT. You can keep putting until you get the ball in the cup. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tTo summarize the physics, you change the force you exert on the charged ball by:\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<ul style= \"list-style-type:disc;padding-left: 18px;\"><li>Changing the amount and sign of the charge on the putter.</li></ul>\r\n\t</br>\r\n\t<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;padding-left: 18px;\"><li>Changing the distance between putter and ball.</li></ul>\r\n\t</br>\r\n\tYou can aim your shots by changing the angle between the putter and the ball.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tSo go play! Try to complete a five-hole course in the fewest number of strokes. A stroke counter will keep track of your progress across all the holes. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t\r\n\t<div class=\"pLabQASection\">\r\n\t\tThe simulation link buttons below lead you to five different miniature golf holes.\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tTo assist you with the diabolical charged sandtraps and hills, some holes show electric field lines. If you have not yet studied electric fields, the instructions that follow may be a little cryptic, but will serve as an introduction to the topic. The electric field shown is created by the charged obstacles. These lines provide a visual outline of the overall electric field caused by the multiple charged obstacles. The field lines point in the direction of the net electric field created by the obstacles. The closer together they are, the stronger the field. The force on the golf ball equals its net charge times the electric field. For a positive charge, the electric field points in the same direction as the force. In sum, if you see a group of field lines closely clustered, you should expect your golf ball to experience a strong force there, roughly in the direction of those field lines. \r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tYou can use the field lines in a manner analogous to how a real golfer reads the rise and fall of a green to determine where and how hard to putt the ball. Take advantage of the field lines to predict how the charged golf ball will behave as it moves across the green. \r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tFor the scorecard to work, you must play and complete the first hole first. If you play the first hole a second time, we assume you are playing a new round (starting over). To go on to a subsequent hole, hit “Next hole” after you have sunk your putt. You can play any hole by clicking on the appropriate button below. \r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tYou can also replay any hole you like by pushing the RESET button while playing that hole. Pressing RESET returns the ball to its initial point and clears the stroke counter to zero for that hole. Pressing RESET does not restart the course, just that hole. \r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tClick below for\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\t<span class=\"pExerciseButton\" data-href=\"course/virtual_labs/8_Force%20between%20charged%20particles/Hole%201_Sign%20and%20direction%20of%20force/\">Hole No. 1</span>\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\t<span class=\"pExerciseButton\" data-href=\"course/virtual_labs/8_Force%20between%20charged%20particles/Hole%202_How%20electric%20forces%20change%20with%20distance/\">Hole No. 2</span>\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\t<span class=\"pExerciseButton\" data-href=\"course/virtual_labs/8_Force%20between%20charged%20particles/Hole%203_How%20the%20charge%20values%20affect%20the%20force/\">Hole No. 3</span>\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\t<span class=\"pExerciseButton\" data-href=\"course/virtual_labs/8_Force%20between%20charged%20particles/Hole%204_Extra%20credit%20−%20Determining%20Coulomb’s%20law/\">Hole No. 4</span>\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\t<span class=\"pExerciseButton\" data-href=\"course/virtual_labs/8_Force%20between%20charged%20particles/Hole%205_Electric%20golf%20−%20the%20practice%20green/\">Hole No. 5</span>\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"pLabQuestion\">\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pLabQNumber\">16.</div><div class=\"pLabQText\"> After you pressed PUTT, did the ball initially head off in the approximate direction of the force exerted on it by the putter?</div><div class=\"pLabQuestionArrow\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pLabAnswerWrapper\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<textarea class=\"pLabAnswerBox\" placeholder=\"Enter your answer here\"></textarea>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pLabSaveButton\" style=\"right: 40px;margin-top: -44px;\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"pLabQuestion\">\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pLabQNumber\">15.</div><div class=\"pLabQText\">  Did the ball always continue moving straight along that direction?

You want to knock the other birds off the wire. You will create a wave pulse in the wire by jiggling it.

Others are more stubborn. You will have to make waves with a variety of heights to knock them all off. The height of a wave − its maximum positive displacement from the equilibrium, or rest, position − is called its <b>amplitude</b>.

The bird pushed and pulled the particles of the telephone wire up and down vertically, while the wave traveled horizontally to the right. The particles that make up the wire move up and down as a wave pulse passes through their location, but they (and the wire) do not move in the direction of the wave pulse.

Wavelength.</figcaption>\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tIn general, the wavelength of a transverse wave is the distance between two adjacent points with the same displacement and at the same part of a wave cycle. For instance, the wavelength is also the distance between two points where the wave is at equilibrium but is rising. (All of this is to say: do not measure wavelength by noting adjacent points where the wave is at equilibrium, since that is one-half a wavelength. If you look at the diagram, you will see what we mean.) \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tWavelength is expressed in units of length, often meters.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tChanging the frequency of a wave in the wire also changes the wavelength of the wave.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tConsider the next exercise, pictured below.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<figure style=\"padding-top:20px;padding-bottom:10px;\">\r\n\t\t<img class=\"pExcersiseThumb\" src=\"course/labs/Speed_frequency_and_wavelength/assets/Ex_03_Wavelength1.png\" style=\"width:70%;\"/>\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\t<figcaption style=\"font-family: AvenirNextLTPro-Demi;\">Exercise 3. Use wavelength to dislodge the birds.</figcaption>\r\n\t</figure>\r\n\t</br>\r\n\tNow some hummingbirds have arrived, and they have coordinated their efforts. They are sitting one meter apart, and the only way they will fly off is if you vibrate the wire so that each bird is at a peak of the wave at precisely the same moment. Each grid square in the figure shown above has a length of 0.25 meters. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tPut another way, you can dislodge the birds if you vibrate the wire so the wavelength of the wave equals one meter, which is the distance between birds (there are other correct answers, but this is the simplest one). \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tExperiment with the frequency until you create a wave that meets these conditions − otherwise no birds will fly off.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tAlso use the simulation to answer the question below.\r\n\t</br>\r\n\t<div class=\"pLabQASection\">\r\n\t\tRemember, GO starts the wave. PAUSE freezes the wave. (This is a particularly good exercise in which to use the PAUSE button because it permits you to see whether the peaks of the waves are reaching the hummingbirds at precisely the same instant.) Press RESET to start over. \r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tA good way to approach this exercise is to first observe how changing the frequency affects the wavelength of the wave. Then, use the PAUSE button to see whether the wavelength needs to be longer or shorter to achieve the goal of knocking the hummingbirds off the wire. Adjust the frequency accordingly. (The wire itself stays the same as you make these changes − it does not stretch nor does its tension change. These points hold true unless we tell you otherwise.) \r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tNote that when the red parrot changes the frequency with which it shakes the wire, it takes several seconds for the new wave to travel the length of the wire. You should wait a few seconds to see if your wave has the desired effect before trying a new wave. \r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tYou are also asked a question below which asks you to state the relationship between frequency and wavelength.\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tAfter you have knocked all the birds off the wire, return here to answer some follow-up questions.\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tClick here to go to the <span class=\"pExerciseButton\" data-href=\"course/virtual_labs/10_Speed,%20frequency%20and%20wavelength/3_Wavelength/\">Exercise 3 Simulation</span>\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"pLabQuestion\">\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pLabQNumber\">6.</div><div class=\"pLabQText\"> Make a graph of wavelength (on the vertical axis) vs. frequency (on the horizontal axis).

The height of a peak is the amplitude of a wave. It is stated in meters. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThe <b>frequency, f</b>, of a wave is the number of complete, up and down cycles per second of a particle in the string. It is stated in hertz (Hz). \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThe <b>wavelength, λ</b>, is the distance between two adjacent identical points in a wave. It is measured in meters. You can measure it as the horizontal distance between two adjacent peaks or two adjacent troughs. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThe <b>wave speed, v</b>, is the speed at which the wave travels along the string. (You were not able to see the waves traveling to and fro in the first exercise, for reasons that will be explained later.) Wave speed is related to the wave frequency and wavelength by the following equation: \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<img src= \"course/labs/Resonance/assets/image30.gif\">\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tWave speed is given in meters per second.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tReview these properties of a wave in the following simulation. It shows a conceptual view of a wave. The wave originates at the left edge of the screen, and moves to the right. There are no boundaries (no places where the string is tied down or attached to struts), so the wave is free to move from left to right without reflecting back. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<div class=\"pLabQASection\">\r\n\t\tIn the simulation, press GO to start the wave moving. Using the grid on the screen, measure and report the wave’s amplitude. Also measure and report the wavelength. (Pressing PAUSE to freeze the wave will assist you in making these measurements. You can press PAUSE again to resume the simulation as well.)\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tUsing the timer in the control panel, determine the frequency and the speed of the wave. You can measure its speed by noting the change in position of a peak over time. Note that the time is displayed in milliseconds, though we report speed in the usual m/s. \r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tUsing the “Time step” buttons may help you make these measurements.

The beginning simulation did not show this level of detail.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tYou now explore what happens when two waves meet at the same place on a plucked string. The waves interfere with one another, and the result of their interference can take several forms. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tTo determine what occurs when two waves or wave pulses meet, you apply the principle of superposition. At every point, the displacement of the combined wave can be determined by adding the displacements of the two source waves. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tObserve superposition in the following simulation. Here, we show a conceptual view of two waves in a string. These are single wave pulses, one of which originates at the left edge of the screen, and the other at the right edge. The wave pulses travel in opposite directions at the same speed and will meet in the middle. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tWhat will be the result if two positive wave pulses (i.e., two peaks) of the same height combine? What if one of the pulses is inverted into a trough (with negative displacement)? What if the two pulse amplitudes differ? \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<div class=\"pLabQASection\">\r\n\t\tUse the simulation to answer the questions stated above.

What is the result when the wave pulses combine?\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tIn order to see the result − and measure it with the background graph − it is helpful to slow the simulation speed as the wave pulses meet. Use the time step function to advance or rewind the experiment, one frame at a time.\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tNext, try combining a peak with an equal amplitude trough. What is the result? (We use a negative sign with the amplitude of a trough to indicate the wave displacement is below the equilibrium position. This is necessary for the simulation, but by convention, amplitude is stated as a positive value.) What happens when wave pulses of amplitude 1.5 m and −1.5 m meet? \r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tTry different displacements, such as 2.0 m for one and 1.0 m for the other.

If the wave machine works in synchronization with the reflected waves to create a standing wave, we say that it is working in resonance. Its motion reinforces the waves, and the amplitude of the resulting standing wave will be greater than the amplitude of the vibrations of the wave machine. This is akin to you pushing a friend on a swing. If you time the frequency of your “pushes” correctly, you will send your friend higher. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThe peaks and troughs of a standing wave stay at fixed positions on the horizontal axis. When you pluck a string, multiple waves travel up and down the string, and multiple standing waves are established in the string. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tNow let’s see how this relates to the musical notes you hear when you pluck a string.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tYou have seen that the higher the frequency of a wave in a particular plucked string, the higher the pitch of the sound produced by the vibrating string. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tAnd you also have seen that the speed of a traveling wave in a string is related to its wavelength and frequency by the following equation: \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<img src= \"course/labs/Resonance/assets/image30.gif\">\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThe speed of a wave is constant in a given string with a fixed tension. Based on the equation above, if v is constant, how could you change the frequency of the wave in our plucked string in order to change the pitch of the sound you hear? \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThe answer is: Change the wavelength of the wave.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tIn the simplest configuration − a string fixed at two ends − one standing wave dominates the rest. It occurs at the fundamental frequency of the string. (We will explore the other standing waves later.) \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThe wavelength of this dominant standing wave is determined by the length of the string. The string is fixed at two ends. When you pluck a string, one-half of a wave appears over the entire length, L, of the string. You see this half wavelength in the diagram below. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<img src= \"course/labs/Resonance/assets/image31.gif\">\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<figure style=\"padding-top:20px;padding-bottom:10px;\">\r\n\t\t<img class=\"pExcersiseThumb\" src=\"course/labs/Resonance/assets/image012.gif\" style=\"width:70%;\"/>\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\t<figcaption style=\"font-family: AvenirNextLTPro-Demi;\">Two nodes make for half a wavelength.</figcaption>\r\n\t</figure>\r\n\t</br>\r\n\tIf you decrease the length of the string, you also decrease the wavelength.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tRemembering that\r\n\t, we can solve this equation for λ and substitute it into the wavelength equation above to derive an equation relating frequency to the wave speed v and length L: \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<img src= \"course/labs/Resonance/assets/image32.gif\">\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThis is the principle at work when you move the wooden end strut of our stringed instrument to change the length of the string. Any change in the length of the string forces a change in the wavelength of the fundamental standing wave on the string. The shorter the string, the shorter the wavelength. The shorter the wavelength, the higher the frequency and the higher the pitch.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThe wave speed v is constant in a particular string at a set tension. This means that the length of the string and the frequency of the dominant standing wave in the string are inversely proportional. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tExperiment with standing waves and frequency in this simulation.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<div class=\"pLabQASection\">\r\n\t\tThis simulation consists of a string stretched between two struts, similar to a guitar string. The wave speed is 200 m/s in this string. You can pluck the string and then listen to the sound created by the vibrating string. You can also observe the vibration of the fundamental standing wave in the string, as we have slowed the motion of the string by 100 times so you can see it. \r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tWithout changing the string length, press PLAY to pluck the string. A standing wave is established in the string. What is its frequency? Its wavelength? Use the simulation to answer these questions, and record your answers in the spaces provided below. \r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tThe rightmost strut holding the string is movable. You can slide it to the left, shortening the effective length of the string (as you do so, the tension of the string remains constant. If the tension were to change, so would the wave speed.) \r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tMove the strut until the length of the string is 1/2 the original length. Remember, this cuts the wavelength of the wave on the string in half as well. Before you try this, predict the frequency. Pluck the string. Is the frequency what you expected? Try some other length ratios, such as 1/3, 1/4 and so on. \r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tFinally, if you want to create a sound of frequency 165 Hz, what would you make the length of the string? Calculate an answer and then try it in the simulation. \r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tReturn here to answer some followup questions when you are done.\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tClick here to enter the <span class=\"pExerciseButton\" data-href=\"course/virtual_labs/11_Resonance/6_Standing%20waves%20and%20frequency/\">Exercise 6 Simulation</span>\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"pLabQuestion\">\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pLabQNumber\">15.</div><div class=\"pLabQText\"> Consider the string at its full length.

The point you pick oscillates up and down, completing a certain number of cycles per second. If you were to pick another particle in the string, it would also oscillate up at down, at the same frequency, but likely with a different amplitude. However, there are special points along the string that bear special attention. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tNodes are points of zero displacement, places on a standing wave where the particles in the medium do not oscillate at all. The fixed endpoints of the string are examples of nodes. That is a trivial example, but we will shortly explain how other nodes can arise between the fixed endpoints. (Perhaps you remember the observations you made in Exercise 5?) \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tAn antinode is a point of maximum displacement, where the standing wave reaches the greatest amplitude. The point at the middle of the string in the exercise above was an antinode. This is where you see the peaks and troughs. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tOne of the intriguing aspects of a stringed instrument is that there are other standing waves on the string at frequencies other than the fundamental one. These other standing waves also have nodes at the fixed ends of the string. In addition, they have one or more nodes positioned at regular intervals along the string. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThese other standing waves, oscillating at different frequencies than the fundamental, create musical notes of a different pitch from the fundamental. This is the reason the sound created when you pluck a single guitar string is so rich. You are hearing multiple notes, as these waves are superposed on top of each other, though the sound is dominated by the fundamental frequency. A harmonic is sometimes called a resonance frequency or a natural frequency. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tGiven a plucked, vibrating string, you can create other standing waves by forcing a node at various positions along the string. If you touch the vibrating string gently in the middle and keep your finger there, you force a change in the shape of the string and create a node at that point, which changes the wavelength of the standing wave. The newly created standing wave has three nodes instead of two. The wavelength is now equal to the length of the string. That is, the wavelength has been cut in half by your action. Since you reduced the wavelength in half, the frequency doubles, and the new pitch is higher. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tYou can go further with this by placing your finger 1/3 of the way along the vibrating string, forcing a node at that position instead. This results in a standing wave with four nodes (one at each end, one that is 1/3 of the way along the string, and a matching one that is 2/3 of the way along the string), and a wavelength only one-third as long as that of the fundamental wave. The frequency of this wave is three times higher than the fundamental frequency. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThese different possible standing waves on a plucked string are called <b>harmonics</b>.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tIn general, a harmonic is a standing wave with a wavelength that obeys this equation:\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<img src= \"course/labs/Resonance/assets/image33.gif\">\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t\t\t\twhere n = 1, 2, 3…. \t\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThe frequency equation now becomes:\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<img src= \"course/labs/Resonance/assets/image34.gif\">\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<div class=\"pLabQASection\">\r\n\t\t</br>\r\n\t\tExperiment with harmonics in the next simulation. It again features a string stretched between two struts, similar to a guitar string. As before, you can pluck the string and listen to the sound created by the vibrating string. You can also observe the vibration of the standing wave in the string, as we have slowed the motion of the string by 100 times so you can see it. \r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tFirst, press PLAY to pluck the string. A standing wave with a frequency of 66 Hz is established in the string.\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tNext to the string you will see a second hand, with the finger pointing down. You can drag this hand to place it between the left strut to the midpoint of the string. It gently touches the vibrating string to cause nodes, and standing waves of different wavelengths. The plucking hand will continue to pluck the string as before. \r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tTry placing the harmonic finger at the halfway point, establishing a node there. What do you think will be the dominant frequency of the vibrating string? \r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tTry some other positions, such as 1/3 of the way from the end, 1/4, etc. Observe the relationship between the point at which the finger is placed, the new wavelength established and the new frequency. \r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tUse the simulation to help you answer the questions below.\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\tClick here to open the <span class=\"pExerciseButton\" data-href=\"course/virtual_labs/11_Resonance/7_Harmonics/\">Exercise 7 Simulation (optional)</span>\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"pLabQuestion\">\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pLabQNumber\">17.</div><div class=\"pLabQText\"> At what fraction of the total string length would you need to place the finger to create a standing wave with five nodes (including the two at the ends)?

The first is a guitar. It is similar to the instrument you have been playing thus far, but this one has eight strings. You can program it by changing string length or using harmonics. You can use the guitar to play the melody of a blues song we have written, or that of any song you like. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThe second instrument is a piano. It has nine strings. You program the notes here the same way as the guitar’s notes. Unlike the other instruments, the piano plays multiple strings at once to form chords to accompany the melody on the guitar. You will tune the strings of the piano, and the chords will be played automatically.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThe third instrument is a bass, with 11 strings. Use it to play the bass line.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tAs you may suspect, this is a good activity for teams of students. Each group can choose an instrument and program the correct notes. When each team is done, the parts can be played simultaneously, either on one computer or on three separate computers, to form a three-part blues band. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tStart by setting the <b>bass</b> line.

If the light is perpendicular to this interface, then the light does not bend at all, regardless of how much its speed changes. However, if the light strikes at an angle, it changes direction.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tIn summary, light may bend when it passes from one medium to another if two conditions are met:\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<ul style='list-style-type:disc;padding-left: 18px;'>\r\n\t\t<li>The speed of the light differs in the media</li>\r\n\t\t<li>The light strikes the interface at any angle that is not perpendicular (“normal”) to the interface</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThis phenomenon is called <b>refraction</b>. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThe light ray in the first medium − in this diagram, the air − is called the <b>incident ray</b>.

Instead, the light ray reflects back into the water.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tWhat is going on?\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThis is called <b>total internal reflection</b>, and it only occurs when light traveling in a higher index of refraction material attempts to pass into a lower index of refraction material. The light also must strike the interface with a large enough angle of incidence. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tUsing Snell's law, you can calculate what minimum angle of incidence will cause total internal reflection.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tLook at the diagram to the right. You know that when light shines up out of the water into air, a faster medium, the refracted beam bends away from the normal according to Snell's law. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<img src= \"course/labs/Refraction/assets/image43.gif\">\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThere is a point at which the angle of refraction in the air − θ<sub>2</sub> − reaches 90°. At this point, the light never leaves the water.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThis angle of incidence is known as the critical angle − marked in the diagram as θc. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tIf light strikes the interface with any incident angle greater than the critical angle, θc, then the light ray will be reflected in total back into the water. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tBecause we know the critical angle is defined by the case where the angle of refraction is equal to 90°, we can solve for the critical angle provided we know the refractive indices of the two materials involved.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tConsider Snell's law for two media. The light travels in the different media at different speeds.\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<img src= \"course/labs/Refraction/assets/image44.gif\">\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\twhere\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tn<sub>slow</sub> is greater than n<sub>fast</sub> and the angle of refraction in the fast medium, θ<sub>2</sub>, is equal to 90 degrees (the beam is refracted along the interface line). \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tSetting θ<sub>2</sub>= 90°, and solving for θ<sub>1</sub>, now renamed θcritical, we find \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<img src= \"course/labs/Refraction/assets/image45.gif\">\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tBecause sin 90° = 1, the critical angle equation is:\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<img src= \"course/labs/Refraction/assets/image46.gif\">\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tThe critical angle is obtained by taking the arcsine:\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<img src= \"course/labs/Refraction/assets/image47.gif\">\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tNote that if light is passing from the fast medium into the slow medium, then it bends toward the normal. In this case, there is no total internal reflection possible. \r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\tWith the critical angle equation in mind, consider the simulation pictured below:\r\n\t</br></br>\r\n\t<figure style=\"padding-top:20px;padding-bottom:10px;\">\r\n\t\t<img class=\"pExcersiseThumb\" src=\"course/labs/Refraction/assets/Ex_07_Total internal reflection2.png\" style=\"width:70%;\"/>\r\n\t\t</br></br>\r\n\t\t<figcaption style=\"font-family: AvenirNextLTPro-Demi;\">Exercise 5.
