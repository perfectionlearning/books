This unit uses several case studies of news and marketing claims, and asks you to evaluate the claims.  ,To judge a marketing claim, we start with the source.  We prefer an unbiased and respected source.  By biased, we mean: Is the claim being made by someone who benefits, financially or otherwise, whether it is true or false?  ,We want to read the claim carefully to make sure we understand precisely what is being said.  Then we want to decide: How relevant is it?  Advertisements may be about a broad topic, such as “sleeping better at night,” but the claim itself may be very specific, such as: “You will fall asleep 15 minutes sooner on average.”  In short, we would prefer a testable hypothesis.,Data is used to test whether a hypothesis is true or false, and that is how any marketing claim should be judged. What data is being supplied to support the claim?  A strong claim will be backed by data available to others, and we would want independent researchers to confirm it.

Today, everything from cellphones to cameras and watches contain GPS technology.,A GPS receiver works by noting its position relative to satellites that send out radio signals. The diagram gives you a sense of how it receives signals from multiple satellites (there are 24 satellites altogether).  The satellites send signals with the exact time and their own location. The GPS chip notes the differences in the arrival times of the radio signals.  Using the basic formula that distance equals the product of speed and elapsed time, it establishes its distance from the various satellites, and uses geometry to determine its own location.,GPS manufacturers market how accurate their system is.    Many mention the system of 24 satellites that send signals.  Some manufacturers claim accuracy within a few meters. ,Another service has sprung up that does not rely on satellites, but, rather, on the location of cell phone towers.

A person with dementia has symptoms such as loss of memory and loss of other brain processing capabilities. Athletes, including football players, sometimes suffer concussions.  ,In recent years, the topic of concussions in football and the effectiveness of football helmets have generated controversy.

These showy objects inspired scientists to understand their orbits, in part to predict when they would return. A crucial piece of the puzzle was what we now call Kepler’s laws of orbits.  Based on observations made by the Danish scientist Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler had concluded that planets move in elliptical orbits, and deduced other aspects of their motion.  However, he could not explain why. ,Technology also played a crucial role.  In the decades preceding Newton, optical telescopes were conceived of, built, and significantly improved. Previously, astronomy had been done without the benefit of lenses or mirrors..  Scientists across the world could now make astronomical observations. Newton used geometry and his theory of gravity to explain the observed elliptical orbits.

Its angular displacement equals its final angular position minus its initial angular position.,The mushroom rotates from an angular position of π/2 radians counterclockwise to π radians, so its angular displacement is positive π/2 radians. If it rotated clockwise instead, its displacement would be negative. ,Angular displacement includes the total angle swept out during the rotation. Let’s say the mushroom made a complete rotation, and then moved another π/2 radians in the same direction. Its angular displacement would be 5π/2 radians. This is 2π radians for the first complete rotation, and another π/2 radians for the rest of its motion.,The equation for angular displacement is shown. The displacement equals the difference between the final and initial angular positions.

As the mass increases, the acceleration decreases, so the period of a mass on a spring will increase with mass.,Notice that the period depends only on the mass and spring constant, not on the amplitude. When the amplitude increases, the mass has to travel farther during a cycle. However, increasing the amplitude also increases the maximum force applied to the mass, which increases its maximum acceleration and results in a greater average speed.

This is why many musical instruments have adjustable tension − so that the moving wave speed on the string can be set by the musician.   ,The possible wavelengths of harmonics is determined by the harmonics. We determined the possible wavelengths of harmonics, but we want to relate them to the possible frequencies, since that is how we perceive sound.  ,To solve for frequency, we use an equation we’ve seen: Wave speed equals the product of  wavelength and frequency.  We solve the equation for frequency, showing that  wavelength and frequency have an inverse relationship − for instance, double the wavelength and the frequency must be halved when the wave speed stays constant.,We apply these relationships to the harmonics.

When the horizontal segments move perpendicularly to the field, the flux is changing most rapidly, and the amount of induced emf is at a maximum. When they move parallel to the field, emf is at a minimum. The direction of the emf, and of the current it causes, changes as the wire loop rotates. The current will flow in one direction for half of every cycle of rotation, and in the other direction during the other half.

Even though there is no battery or generator in the right-hand circuit, the light bulb lights up. This is an example of mutual induction. ,What causes the current in the second circuit? A current-carrying wire creates a magnetic field: The greater the current, the stronger the field. In the upper diagram, as current begins to flow through the circuit on the left, the associated magnetic field strength increases. You can see this in the animation. We pause the animation at a time when the current is still increasing. ,The magnetic field from the circuit on the left intersects the circuit on the right.

This included the fact that the gravitational force is an inverse square law − the amount of force lessens by the square of the distance.,This insight caused other scientists investigating the electric force to consider that it too might be an inverse square law.  The Englishman Joseph Priestley, a scientist with many other interests, is credited with suggesting in 1767  the hypothesis that the force is an inverse square law.  ,The French engineer Charles Coulomb built a sophisticated piece of equipment, a torsional balance, to measure the force.  In the 1780s he conducted experiments to prove that it was in fact an inverse square law and to calculate k, the constant we use. ,Interest in electric charge continued as scientists and engineers learned to store it, in devices that developed into batteries, and to take advantage of the energy to power other devices.

One observation that baffled scientists was that it could be shown that the Earth’s magnetic field slowly changed over time.  The respected scientist Edmond Halley hypothesized (incorrectly) that Earth was composed of multiple shells that moved.  It was a clever hypothesis, but incorrect (Earth’s core is a molten metal).,Progress in the understanding of the magnetic force (and the field related to it) came from a scientist attempting to do a science demonstration for students and friends in 1820. Hans Christian Oersted, a Danish professor, was attempting to show a simple compass, but he noticed that every time an electric current was turned on, the magnetic needle moved.  It would orient itself perpendicular to the line of the current. ,Oersted wrote up his discovery without explanation.  But it was the first significant indication of the relationship of electric charge and magnetic fields. The French scientist André-Marie Ampére pushed the knowledge further.  He asked: if one current could create a magnetic force, should a pair of current-carrying wires be able to apply magnetic forces on each other?  He was correct in thinking that they do.

He used an ammeter to measure electric current in the wires. Faraday had always connected the battery in the first circuit before he connected an ammeter in the second, and he detected no current in the second circuit. However, on the morning of August 29, Faraday connected the ammeter first and then connected the battery. To his delight, he detected a momentary current in the second circuit; connecting the battery after the ammeter meant that the ammeter was measuring what happened as the current changed in the first circuit.,Physicist James Clerk Maxwell’s brilliant studies pioneered research into the nature of electromagnetic waves. He correctly concluded in 1865 that oscillating electric and magnetic fields can constitute a self-propagating wave that he called electromagnetic radiation. His correction to some of Ampére’s work (showing that a changing electric field causes a magnetic field) combined with Faraday’s law (a changing magnetic field causes an electric field) supplies the basis for understanding this kind of wave.,It took years to demonstrate that Maxwell’s work of 1865 was correct.  In 1886 the German physicist Heinrich Hertz built what we today would call a radio transmitter and receiver, which produced electromagnetic radiation. In later experiments, he demonstrated that the radiation moved at the speed of light.  His experiments provided the experimental proof of Maxwell’s conclusions.

The slits were small, with a width comparable to the wavelength of the light. The light traveled through two parallel slits, and the waves that came through each slit combined along the viewing screen.

The mask functions as a radiation stencil for the circuit pattern. The mask matches the circuits that a circuit designer wants created, just as we might use a stencil to create letters in a sign. ,The mask is placed in front of a light-sensitive layer of material, known as resist, that is on top of the chip material. Where radiation passes through the mask, it causes a chemical reaction in the light-sensitive resist material. The exposed regions are chemically developed and removed, forming a stencil. Then, metal can be deposited through the narrow openings in the resist to form the circuits.  A lift-off process then removes all of the undeveloped resist and unwanted metal.

During parts of the year it appeared earlier than he would expect, and during other parts, it would appear later.,Roemer found it difficult to convince his colleagues that the moon had such “timing” problems. To convince them, Roemer correctly predicted exactly how “off-schedule” the moon would be.   ,The important question was: Why did the moon appear sooner or later than simple calculations of its orbital period would predict? Roemer realized the difference was due to the changing distance between Earth and Jupiter as they orbit about the Sun. ,Roemer noted that Io appeared sooner when the planets were closer, and later when they were farther apart.  The differing distances between the planets meant that the sunlight reflected off of Io traveled different distances between that moon and Earth due to the changing distance between those bodies.,Using the differing distances and the “errors” in the time Io appeared, another astronomer, Christiaan Huygens, calculated the speed of light.

Scattering explains why the sky is blue, and also explains why scattered light from the sky is polarized.,To explain scattering, we start with unpolarized light coming straight from the Sun, striking an electron of an atom in Earth’s atmosphere. The electric fields of the incoming waves shake the electron up and down and side to side.,The vibrating electrons then re-emit light waves at the original frequency. This absorption and re-emission of light is called scattering. Light is a transverse wave, so re-emitted waves may only be scattered in a direction perpendicular to the vibration of the electron. For example, electrons that are shaken up and down can only emit light in horizontal directions. Also, only electrons that oscillate side to side, in a horizontal plane, can re-emit a wave that travels downward to an observer on the ground.  This means that to a ground observer, scattered skylight is polarized, in roughly a north-south direction.,Not all wavelengths (colors) of light scatter equally.  The chance of scattering light of a certain wavelength is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the light’s wavelength. So, the shorter wavelengths, which we perceive as blue, scatter the most.  Their direction is more likely to be changed when they pass through the atmosphere, meaning blue light is scattered downward, turning the sky blue.

Antimatter is like a twin version of matter, but with opposite electric charge (and other properties that we haven’t discussed, such as lepton and baryon number).  At the birth of the Universe, equal amounts of matter and antimatter should have been produced by the Big Bang. When matter and antimatter particles meet, they annihilate each other, transforming into energy. Somehow, a tiny fraction of matter must have survived to form the Universe we live in today, with hardly any antimatter left. Why does Nature appear to have this bias for matter over antimatter?,Einstein showed that the three dimensions of space are related to time. Later theories propose that additional, hidden dimensions of space may exist.  For example, string theory, which is a theory that attempts to explain all of the fundamental forces (including gravitation), implies that there are additional spatial dimensions yet to be observed. These may become detectable at very high energies, so data from all the detectors will be carefully analyzed to look for signs of extra dimensions."},{"src":"24:4:0:0","type":"book","title":"Ch 24: Advances in Physics","sectionTitle":"Solar Power","sectionHeading":"4.0 Solar Power","text":"  Essential Question: How are the properties of subatomic particles discovered?,  Enduring Understandings  :1.

For instance, droughts are worsening in parts of Africa, decreasing the supply of water and traditional sources of food. A lack of reliable water sources is a major constraint to an adequate food supply.,One potential solution is hydroponic farming.  With hydroponic farms, traditional soil is not used, but rather different media, or solely water.  This farming method allows for very efficient water use.  Conserving water is one of the two highest priorities of these systems.,One way to make hydroponic farming accessible is by installing farms within recycled truck containers.  These are the rectangular containers being pulled behind semis on the highway. ,Inside the containers, plants are grown on vertical racks, with their roots planted in water that is laced with nutrients.  LED lights supply the light necessary for photosynthesis. A single container farm produces the same amount of food as that produced by an acre of traditional farmland, while requiring just 5 to 10 gallons of water per day. ,The container also meets an important cultural need, allowing a community to be self-sustaining and use its own labor for at least some of its food supply, instead of relying on outside sources.

This is only an estimate − a starting point to calculating a more accurate number.  We start with two pieces of information supplied by the manufacturer − the container farm system uses about 100 kWh of electrical energy each day and has its lights on for 16 hours.  To convert energy to power, we divide the 100 kWh by 16 to get 6,250 watts.,Next, we estimate how many solar panels are needed.  The single solar panel we are considering typically supplies a peak power of 250 watts.  We put one factor in the spreadsheet that reduces the power output − the conversion from DC to AC electricity. Dividing the farm’s power requirement by the power supplied by a panel, we find the number of panels (we round to an integer).  Then, using a current U.S. price for solar panels, we multiply quantity by price per panel to get the total cost of the panels.,The spreadsheet supplies a rough estimate of the costs − the panels are over $20,000. There are many ways to improve this estimate.  For example, we used the peak power of the panel − which requires peak sunlight.  Tools on the Internet allow you to create a more accurate, location-based estimate of the real average power a panel will supply.  We recall that the farm requires light (and power) 16 hours a day − longer than the sun typically is present.

The question for this section is: How many years? A faster payback is better.We start with an estimate for power in one African country, Somalia.  Electrical energy costs about $0.18 per kilowatt hour.  Since the price is quoted in kilowatt hours, we calculate how many kilowatt hours the container farm will require per year.  Multiplying that energy requirement in kWh by the cost of electrical energy per kWh, we calculate the annual cost of electricity for the farm, if we had to buy it from the utility. ,We then divide the cost of the solar panels by the annual cost of electricity to determine how many years it will take to pay back the investment in solar panels.  This is one way to determine whether an investment is worth pursuing.  As a rough rule of thumb, an investment with a payback of fewer than 10 years might be viewed as a good one, while one taking longer than that might be viewed as an investment to avoid.  ,As we mentioned earlier, the cost of the solar power system might be higher than our estimate.  If so, this would increase the time required to pay for the system.  We also mentioned that one downside to solar power is that the lights are required to be on for about 16 hours/day, which is longer than the sun typically shines.

Energy supplies the capacity for doing work − it is the source of the force required to propel a car, lift an elevator and so on.  Energy in the form of heat also keeps us warm.As much energy as is now consumed, likely more will be consumed in the future: one group estimates a 40% increase by 2040. The source of much of today’s energy comes from oil, natural gas and coal.  The low cost of these energy sources is an essential criterion for their use. However, using these resources generates carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming.  So now the search for energy has the essential criteria not only of cost but also of impact on the environment. Society requires “clean” energy sources that do not release carbon dioxide or other damaging waste products.,Nuclear reactors are one source of energy that does not produce carbon dioxide. They are powered by nuclear fission.  During fission, material such as uranium 235 radioactively decays into smaller nuclei, and releases energy.  Matter is converted into energy, and using the equation E = mc2, one can calculate the energy release, and confirm the conservation of mass-energy, which is to say the sum of mass and energy.,Power plants based on nuclear fission (nuclear power plants) can produce significant amounts of power − over 1,300 megawatts.

In the early days of nuclear power, it was believed that plants would be so inexpensive to run that power might be free.  Unfortunately, this claim proved to be far from true. Nuclear power plants cost billions of dollars to construct.,In addition to its high initial cost, nuclear power has other shortcomings.  One is safety, because some plants have failed.  Plant failure results in the destructive release of radioactivity, as with the extensive damage surrounding the failed plants at Chernobyl and Fukushima.,Disposing of the radioactive waste from the plant poses environmental challenges, since the waste remains radioactive for thousands of years.  The plants, though most would judge them far from satisfying any aesthetic criteria, are typically placed in remote locations and are visible to few people, which makes this a minor criteria. However, nuclear operators struggle to convince society that the plants can meet the essential constraint of safety.,A nuclear power plant is expensive to build.  Proposed new plants have construction costs in the billions of dollars.  Two main factors are often calculated for nuclear plants.  One is the cost per kilowatt to build the plant − which is often $3,000 to $8,000 per kW. These kilowatts are supplied by the plant for its useful lifespan, which may range from 40 to 60 years.  ,Once the plant is built, then it must be supplied with fuel and operated by a staff.

Assumptions required to estimate the price to consumers include the costs of plants (building and operating costs often run higher than anticipated), the cost of uranium fuel (which must be projected 40 or even 60 years in the future), how long a plant will last, and many other factors. ,Some of the most intense debate about nuclear plants concerns “externalities” − costs that are not directly related to the operators and customers of the plant.  Nuclear-power supporters argue that nuclear plants do not contribute to global warming and can be safely operated.  This is a benefit to all, not just to customers of the plant. It is an externality.,Critics point to a trade-off: the challenges of storing nuclear waste and the widespread environmental damage of plant failures.

Airplanes are also constrained by the need for large amounts of land for an airport and crowded skies over cities. In addition to quantitative criteria such more rapid transportation, there is the qualitative goal of reducing the stress of the frequent sounds of airplanes overhead.,One way to address this problem is not to try to improve airplanes, but rather to think differently about satisfying the criteria of rapid transportation of people between major urban areas. A possible solution is a train − not the traditional train you may think of, but one using a new generation of train technology, operating on a system that differs significantly from a traditional “train track.” This proposed next generation of trains are called hyperloop trains.,One part of the design of hyperloop trains is the use of magnetic fields, but hyperloop trains are not unique here.

By “initial,” we mean the velocity when the ball first exits the cart, and the velocity components of the cart at that time. If your equipment does not have the capability of measuring vertical speeds, use descriptions such as “slow,” “medium,” “fast,” and “same as in previous trial.” One method to measure the constant horizontal velocity of the ball and the cart is for you to lay a meterstick parallel to the cart’s path and use a stopwatch to determine how long it takes the cart to cover a certain distance.

Question 1 A ballistic pendulum is used to measure the speed of a small, fast-moving object (such as a bullet or ball). In this lab, you will fire a ball at the pendulum. Both the ball and pendulum will rise together. In later trials, you can fire the balls at different velocities, or you may have different balls to fire. Do you expect momentum to be conserved during the collision? How about kinetic energy? Hypothesis A hypothesis is a brief statement that describes what you expect your experiment to show.

Measure its mass by using a digital scale or a triple beam balance.   Measure the mass of the pendulum. Set the velocity of the launcher. Launch the ball. Note the height to which the pendulum rises.. Repeat this experiment several times. If you have different mass balls, repeat the experiment with different mass balls.   Discussion Momentum is conserved in any collision, inelastic or elastic, when no net external forces act. You can consult your textbook for more on momentum conservation. The initial momentum of the system is mv. We use lowercase letters for the mass and velocity of the ball. Immediately after the collision, the momentum is (m + M)V. We use uppercase letters for the mass of the pendulum and its velocity.We can write an equation for the velocity of the pendulum and ball immediately after the collision. mv = (m + M)V We can solve this equation for the initial velocity of the ball:  There is some energy loss during the totally inelastic collision, but immediately after the collision, energy is conserved. Both the ball and the pendulum are moving at velocity V. At the peak of the motion, all the mechanical energy is in gravitational potential energy. The variable h represents how high the combined ball/pendulum rises.    Question  If your equipment allows you to measure the speed of the pendulum immediately after the collision: From the final height, solve the second equation for the velocity of the pendulum plus ball immediately after the collision. How does your value compare to the speed of the pendulum that you observe?  Use the first equation to solve for the initial velocity of the fast-moving ball as a function of the height of the pendulum, the two masses, and g.

Keep a clean and orderly work space. If you break or spill something, notify your instructor immediately. If someone needs first aid, notify your instructor immediately. When you have completed an experiment, always dispose of, recycle, or store equipment and supplies in their proper locations. If in doubt: Ask!   Question 1 If electrons flow from cathode to anode through the tube, what will be the effect of placing a magnet near the CRT? Hypothesis A hypothesis is a brief statement that describes what you expect your experiment to show. You know the right hand rule for predicting the behavior of moving charged particles in a magnetic field. What should happen to the beam of electrons (careful: they are negatively charged) in the magnetic field produced by the horseshoe magnet? Draw a sketch in your lab notebook predicting what will happen, and state your hypothesis for the question above. Steps in the Experiment  Apply the filament voltage until the filament glows. Next, apply an accelerating voltage until the beam is emitted. In many CRTs built for physics demonstrations, a phosphor screen (that spans the length of the tube) glows when struck by electrons, making the beam visible. Check the accelerating voltage with a multimeter. Place the horseshoe magnet near the tube so that the north pole is on one side and the south pole is on the other. (If in doubt as to which is which, check the polarity using a magnetic compass. The end of the needle that points roughly toward the geographic north pole is a magnetic north pole, and opposite poles attract.) You should notice that the beam bends. Describe and sketch the results.

If in doubt: Ask!   Question 1 A major advance in understanding atomic structure came with the hydrogen atom model, proposed by Niels Bohr. The electron was assumed to be in a circular orbit about the proton, held there by electrostatic attraction. Bohr postulated that only certain orbits are allowed. The orbits are labeled by the “quantum number” n, which takes on positive integer values: n = 1, 2, 3, ... The n = 1 orbit (“the ground state”) has the lowest energy. The electron is usually found in the ground state and tends to move toward that state when in a higher energy state. Bohr further postulated that an electron can change orbits only by absorbing or emitting a single photon, whose energy is equal to the energy difference between the two levels. (Energy is absorbed if the new orbit has higher energy than the original orbit, and energy is emitted if it has lower energy.) When energy is emitted or absorbed, it appears in the form of electromagnetic energy, a single photon of light. The frequency or wavelength of the photon (i.e., the color of the light) is related to the energy. In this lab, electrons are bumped up to higher energy levels by a high electric potential, and they cascade down to the ground level, emitting photos as they fall, producing an emission spectrum. Bohr concluded that the emission spectrum for different gases should be unique, consisting of a characteristic set of wavelengths. The particular “fingerprint” for each gas corresponds to the differences in energy between the various energy levels. Aim your handheld visual spectroscope at a mini incandescent light bulb in a socket, powered by a battery. You will see a continuous spectrum. You will see the same thing if you look at a sunlight-illuminated cloud. NOTE: NEVER point your instrument directly at the sun! Permanent eye damage could result. Next, aim your handheld visual spectroscope at the gas discharge tube. Do you expect a continuous spectrum of emission lines, or only a handful of narrow emission lines?  Hypothesis A hypothesis is a brief statement that describes what you expect your experiment to show. State your hypothesis for the question above.  Steps in the Experiment  Turn on the power supply. The gas begins to glow. Aim your handheld visual spectroscope at the light. Sketch and describe the results.    Question 2 Find out what gas is in your discharge tube (if you have it, it is best to start with hydrogen gas, the simplest atom). Look up the typical energy levels for that gas. Referring to your textbook, a periodic table, and to an electromagnetic spectrum chart, predict some of the wavelengths in the visible spectrum that you will see. Hypothesis State your hypothesis for the question above. Steps in the Experiment  Turn on the power supply. The gas begins to glow. Aim your handheld visual spectroscope at the light. Record the wavelengths of the lines that you see. Create a table with the results. Compare the spectrum you see to the one in your spectrum chart. In what region of the electromagnetic spectrum are these lines?    Question 3 Does changing the gas in the discharge tube change the emission spectrum? Hypothesis State your hypothesis for the question above. Steps in the Experiment  Use discharge tubes with different gases, such as H, He, Ne and Ar. Change the discharge tube so that you are using one with a different gas.  Use gloves, and do not touch the tube with your bare hands. Turn on the power supply. The gas begins to glow.

You will measure the acceleration of the vehicle. Identify the Variables Use “F” for force, “m” for mass, “d” for distance, and “t” for time. Steps in the Experiment Prepare a Data Collection Chart  Create a Data Collection Chart to record the following for each of three trials Mass of the vehicle (constant) Total mass of slotted masses Total mass of vehicle and slotted masses Force exerted by spring scale Acceleration of vehicle across the plank Observations  Set Up Apparatus Place the plank on a table or desk and let one end hang slightly over the edge. Use the level to help you make minor adjustments to ensure the plank is level. For example, you may have to insert a thin piece of cardboard at one end. Mount the motion sensor on the end of the plank away from the pulley. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to set up all hardware and software that accompanies the motion sensor. You will use the manufacturer’s data collection software to collect and analyze your data. Set up the software to collect velocity vs. time. Place the block of wood in front of the pulley and secure it from the side of the plank with a C-clamp. (This block of wood will stop your vehicle and mark the end of the distance traveled.) Place the vehicle on the plank. Extend the length of string over the top of the pulley. To the end of the string opposite the vehicle, tie a spring scale. Suspend the mass hanger from the spring scale.  Vary the Force  Set the vehicle at the end of the plank opposite the pulley. Hold the vehicle in position while your partner adds a slotted mass to the mass hanger. Record the value of the weight used as well as the force indicated by the spring scale in your Data Collection Chart. Coordinate when you will let go of the vehicle so that your partner can signal the software to start recording data. Repeat steps 13−16 for three different slotted masses or combinations of slotted masses.  Analyze Your Results Calculate and Graph Your Results For each of your data runs, make a graph of velocity vs. time and do a straight line fit. Find the slope of the line.  Question Why should this be a straight line? What is the interpretation of the slope? Hypothesis A hypothesis is a brief statement that describes what you expect your experiment to show. State your hypothesis for the question above.  Create a summary graph for the experiment that illustrates the relationship of force to acceleration.  Compare and Contrast Describe the relationship of mass, force, and acceleration based on the graph you created. What modification to the experimental procedure would you recommend to be sure the results were more consistent?  Evaluate Your Data Is Your Data Reasonable? In order to determine if your data is reasonable, consider the following questions: Are the calculated values reasonable based on the data used for the calculation? If you know a formula that relates the values you measured, does your data match those values? Are you getting the same general results as other lab groups? If the answer to any question above is “no,” it does NOT mean your lab results are wrong. But you may want to try to re-create the same experiment, for example, run another series of trials, to see if you get the same results. This may get rid of mistakes, such as mistakes in measurement or in recording values.  Determine Sources of Uncertainty  In every experiment there are potential sources of error and/or instances of a lack of accuracy and precision. Explain what sources of error and lack of accuracy and precision might be in this experiment.   Form Your Conclusion Think Critically  If your experiments proved your hypotheses, your conclusion is merely a restatement of your hypotheses. If your experiments did not prove your hypotheses, you may have to design additional experiments and form new hypotheses based on your new experimental data. If this is the case, ask your instructor if there is time to redesign and re-run one or more of your experiments. What scientific laws or theories have you studied that support your experiences in these experiments? Create a summary statement that relates force, mass, and acceleration.  State Your Conclusion After considering the information in the Think Critically section and reviewing the experiences, observations, data, and calculations of these experiments, state your conclusion. Be sure to compare your results to the laws and theories you have studied and to explain your reasoning.

Discussion: Like charges attract and opposite charges repel. By rubbing an object such as a glass rod with another material, you can charge each of the objects. Electrons are added or removed from the rod, leaving it with either a negative or a positive charge, respectively. Steps in Experiment 1: Two different rods  Rub the glass rod with silk cloth. Rub the rubber rod with fake fur and place it on the stand. What happens if you bring the glass rod near the rubber rod? Do they have the same charge or different charges? How can you tell?   Steps in Experiment 2: The same type of rod  Rub one glass rod with silk cloth. Place it on the stand. Rub the other glass rod with silk cloth. Do you think the glass rods have the same or opposite types of charges? Do you expect them to repel or to attract one another? Place one rod near the other. Repeat this experiment with a pair of rubber rods and the fake fur.   Experiment 3: An electroscope Discussion: An electroscope can be used to detect nearby electrically charged objects. We will assume that the charged object is a rod and that we have a gold-leaf electroscope. To use it, bring the rod near the ball at the top of the electroscope. The rod induces a charge in the leaves, either by repelling electrons from the ball into the leaves (if the rod is negatively charged) or by attracting electrons out of the leaves toward the ball (if the rod is positively charged). No contact is required.  The amount the leaves separate will increase with the strength and closeness of the rod. The electroscope cannot tell you if the rod is positively or negatively charged—only if it is charged.  Create a charge on a glass rod by rubbing it with silk. Place it near the electroscope’s ball. What happens to the leaves? As you move the rod closer and then farther away, what happens to the distance the leaves are separated? Repeat steps 11 and 12 with a charged rubber rod.

Does friction depend on the normal force or on the speed at which the surfaces slide over one another? Kinetic friction forces are exerted by surfaces sliding on each other. The forces depend on the details of the microscopic contact between the sliding surfaces. Consequently, friction forces vary with the materials in contact, the state of each surface (smoothness, cleanliness, etc.), and the force pressing the surfaces together.

When you have completed an experiment, always dispose of, recycle, or store equipment and supplies in their proper locations. If in doubt: Ask!   Measuring the Kinetic Friction Coefficient Discussion The coefficient of kinetic friction (mK) is the ratio of the kinetic frictional force to the normal force (the perpendicular force pressing the surfaces together). Doubling the normal force roughly doubles the friction force, so mK is approximately constant. In this experiment, these properties of kinetic friction will be tested for several surface pairs. Question For contact between wood and the table surface, would you expect mK to be approximately independent of the normal force and the speed?  Hypothesis A hypothesis is a brief statement that describes what you expect your experiment to show. State your hypothesis for the question above. Steps in Experiment 1: Kinetic Friction Coefficient and Normal Force and Speed  The idea is to set up the apparatus so that the friction block slides along a horizontal track, pulled by a string that passes over a pulley with table clamp. If the block moves at constant velocity, then the tension in the string equals the kinetic frictional force.  Place the larger wooden side of the friction block facing down toward the table, and add 500 g of mass on top of it. Run the string from the friction block over the pulley and down to the hanging mass hanger with slotted or hooked masses. Use a spring scale or a triple beam balance to measure the total mass.  An ultrasonic motion sensor monitors the velocity of the friction block as a function of time. Add some mass on the hanging mass holder, and tap the friction block so that it starts slowly moving along the track. Collect data for the velocity as a function of time. Adjust the hanging mass until the graph of velocity vs. time is a horizontal line, indicating constant velocity.  Add some mass to the top of the friction block and repeat, until you have 3 trials in all. For each trial, calculate the normal force, the tension in the string, and then the coefficient of kinetic friction between the two surfaces.    Question Would you expect mK to be approximately independent of contact area? Hypothesis A hypothesis is a brief statement that describes what you expect your experiment to show. State your hypothesis for the question above. Steps in Experiment 2: Kinetic Friction Coefficient and Area of Contact  Repeat steps 1-7, placing the narrow wooden surface on the table.   Question For contact between felt and the table surface, would you expect mK to be larger or smaller than between wood and the table surface?  Hypothesis A hypothesis is a brief statement that describes what you expect your experiment to show. State your hypothesis for the question above. Steps in Experiment 3: Kinetic Friction Coefficient and Materials  Repeat steps 1-7, placing a wide or narrow felt surface on the table. Compare the results to those obtained between wood and the table surface.    Measuring the Static Friction Coefficient Discussion Static friction resists the sliding motion of two objects that are stationary relative to one another. The coefficient of static friction (mS) is the ratio of the maximum static frictional force to the normal force (the perpendicular force pressing the surfaces together).  Question You can use a friction block on an inclined plane to calculate the coefficient of static friction between two materials. As the plane is inclined more and more from the horizontal, at some point the block just begins to slide. At that moment, what is the relationship between the static friction coefficient and the angle of inclination of the plane from the horizontal?  Hypothesis A hypothesis is a brief statement that describes what you expect your experiment to show. State your hypothesis for the question above. Steps in Experiment 4: Static Friction Coefficient  Place the friction block on an inclined plane. Measure the angle of inclination, using a protractor or by using trigonometry. Incline the plane until the force of gravity just overcomes friction and causes the friction block to slide. Now, repeat the experiment and incline it just a hair less. The plane is now at the angle at which the maximum force of static friction just balances the component of the block’s weight that is directed down the plane.  At this point, the static friction is at its maximum and you can calculate the coefficient of static friction.

When you have completed an experiment, always dispose of, recycle, or store equipment and supplies in their proper locations. If in doubt: Ask!   Discussion: We will use the thin lens equation.  The variable f is the focal length, the distance at which a lens focuses an image when the object is an infinite distance away. The variable do represents the object distance, and di represents the image distance.  Steps in Experiment 1: Computing the focal length with a faraway object  To determine the focal length of the convex (converging) lens, mount the lens on the optics bench, and place the viewing screen on the same bench. By sliding the screen back and forth relative to the lens, focus the image of a distant bright object, such as a window, onto the screen.  Have your partner measure the distance from the lens to the screen. This is the image distance. For a single convex lens, the object and image distances are both positive numbers.  The object is relatively very far away. As the object distance approaches infinity, what does the value of  approach?  With your object far away, you can use the simplified equation  to calculate the lens’s focal length. In this special case, the equation simplifies to “the focal length equals the image distance.”  Repeat this with a second convex lens. Is the image real or virtual? How can you tell?

For a single convex lens, the object and image distances are both positive numbers.  Move the lens to a second position where the image is in focus. Again, record the distances.

One is the ratio of image and object size, with M representing magnification. For a single convex lens, the image will be inverted with respect to the object, and by convention, the image height is reported as a negative number.   The magnification also equals the ratio of the image and object distances.  Steps in Experiment 4  Pick a lens. Place an illuminated object at a particular distance, and slide the screen until the image is in sharp focus. Measure the image and object heights with a caliper. Determine the magnification of the lens by using the ratio of heights. Be careful of the sign of your answer. Now determine the magnification by using the ratio of distances.

Experiment 1: A toy moving at constant velocity Discussion Position, velocity, and acceleration are all related through a branch of mathematics known as calculus. There are also useful graphical interpretations of these concepts. By analyzing a graph or a function of one of these variables, one can find out what is happening with the other two. Position (x) locates an object along an axis. The change in position (displacement) of the object between 2 times is equal to the area under a velocity-time graph. Velocity (v) is the time rate of change of position. Graphically, instantaneous velocity (in one dimension, i.e., along a particular direction) is the slope of the position-time graph.

Steps in Experiment 1: A toy moving at constant velocity  Connect your interface box to your computer, plug in the power supply, and turn on the interface. Mount your ultrasonic motion sensor on a ring stand, using clamps and 90-degree rod clamps. Connect the sensor to the interface box. Orient the motion sensor so it points along the table at the wind-up toy. Make sure you can watch the computer display as the toy moves.  Start the computer program and ask it to display graphs of position, velocity, and acceleration against time. Wind up the toy and set it on the table. Start taking data. You may hear a clicking noise from the ultrasonic sensor. Choose your best run for further analysis. To curve fit the data, click the \"Fit\" icon located just above the graph, with a \"Linear Fit\" option. The program will display information about the line of best fit through your data.  Record the equation of the line of best fit for your position data using the slope and intercept shown by the \"Linear Fit\" function. The standard equation for a linear fit is y = m×x + b, where m is the slope and b is the y intercept. In this case, the slope of the position data, which is the derivative of the linear function, represents the velocity.   Experiment 2: A toy moving with constant acceleration Discussion If a toy car is allowed to roll down an inclined plane, the component of gravity down the plane will give it a constant acceleration. Question If a small toy car moves with constant acceleration, what will its position vs. time graph look like? What about its velocity vs. time graph? What about its acceleration vs. time graph?  Hypothesis A hypothesis is a brief statement that describes what you expect your experiment to show. State your hypothesis for the question above. Question If the plane is inclined at an angle of θ off the horizontal, what is the expected acceleration of the toy car down the plane? Assume that it moves just like a frictionless object sliding down the inclined plane.  Hypothesis A hypothesis is a brief statement that describes what you expect your experiment to show. State your hypothesis for the question above. Steps in Experiment 2: A toy moving with constant acceleration  Set up an inclined plane by putting a small object under one end of a flat board or something similar. Measure the angle of inclination from the horizontal using a protractor, or by making linear measurements and using trigonometry. Set up the data acquisition sensor as before, only now, clamp the motion sensor with the ring stand, clamps, and 90-degree clamps so that it points down the inclined plane, parallel to its surface. Start the computer program and ask it to display graphs of position, velocity, and acceleration against time. Set the toy car at the top of the inclined plane, about 10 cm in front of the motion sensor. Let go of the car, and start taking data. You may hear a clicking noise from the ultrasonic sensor. Choose your best run for further analysis. To curve fit the data, click the \"Fit\" icon located just above the graph, with a \"Linear Fit\" option if the data points fall on a straight line, or a \"Quadratic Fit\" or \"second-degree fit\" if the data points fall on a parabola (a special kind of curve). The program will display information about the best fit through your data.  By looking at the parameters of your best fit lines and parabolas, you will be able to determine the acceleration of the car. How do the numbers compare to what you expect from theory?   Is Your Data Reasonable? In order to determine if your data is reasonable, consider the following questions:  If you know a formula that relates the values you measured, does your data match those values?  If you have calculated any values, are those values reasonable based on the data used for the calculation?  Are you getting the same general results as other lab groups are getting?  If the answer to any question above is \"no,\" it does NOT mean your lab results are wrong. But you may want to try to retake some measurements, for example, remeasuring the current through a resistor, to see if you get the same results as before.  Determine Sources of Uncertainty  In every experiment there are potential sources of error and/or instances of a lack of accuracy and precision. Explain what sources of error or lack of accuracy and precision might be in this lab.

A detailed analysis will show that the period actually increases very slightly as the amplitude increases. Fortunately, if the amplitude is kept to a few degrees, the formula above is accurate to better than 0.1%. You don't have to measure the amplitude accurately: just keep the amplitude fairly small.  Design an Experiment Given what you know about the relationship of period, pendulum length and g, how can you use a pendulum to measure g? Try to design your experiment before you read onward.

Steps in the Experiment  Create a Data Collection Chart Create a chart with the following columns  Column 1: Length of the pendulum (m)  Column 2: Period of oscillation (s)   Attach the top end of the string to the pendulum support. Attach the smallest mass to the lower end of the string, and adjust the support so that L is about a meter. Carefully measure L from the top of the string to the center of the mass. Start the pendulum swinging with a small amplitude, and measure the period by timing 10 full oscillations with a stopwatch (don’t forget to divide the total time by 10).  Repeat the previous 2 steps for five more values of L, down to about half a meter. Make a graph of T2 (vertical axis) vs. L (horizontal axis). Determine the slope of your best line through the data.

Uncertainty in measured data For a single value of L, have one lab partner measure T with a stopwatch, for one back and forth swing of the pendulum. Then have the other lab partners do the same thing. Is there a relatively large “spread” in the results? To quantify the “spread”, calculate the standard deviation of the different measurements. Identify the causes of the uncertainty in your measured data. What are some reasons that the lab partners got different results? Didn’t you all measure the same thing?

Then have the other lab partners do the same thing. Is there a smaller “spread” in the results? To quantify the “spread”, calculate the standard deviation of the different measurements.

Light waves are transverse; the electric and magnetic fields oscillate perpendicular to the direction of light propagation. In order to explain linear polarization, let’s consider another transverse wave: a mechanical wave on a long rope. Tie one end to a tree, stretch the rope taut, and shake the other end wildly and randomly. The rope particles will oscillate in all directions that are perpendicular to the wave motion. This is an unpolarized wave. Now suppose the rope passes through a white picket fence. On the other side of the fence, the rope oscillates up and down only, in a vertical plane. (One could say that the fence had a vertical transmission axis.) When the vibration of a transverse wave lies in a plane at a fixed orientation in space, the wave is said to be linearly polarized.

When you have completed an experiment, always dispose of, recycle or store equipment and supplies in their proper location. If in doubt: Ask!   Intensity of Unpolarized Light After Polarization Discussion: Light that passes through a linear polarizer is linearly polarized, parallel to the transmission axis. For unpolarized incident light, the intensity of the polarized light that emerges is one-half of what it was initially. The linear polarizer extinguishes all components of the electric field that are perpendicular to the transmission axis, so it makes sense that the light is dimmer.  Question 1 If you place a linear polarizer in front of unpolarized light, it is half as intense on the other side. What do you think will happen to the brightness if the linear polarizer is rotated? Will the intensity change? Hypothesis A hypothesis is a brief statement that describes what you expect your experiment to show. State your hypothesis for the question above.  Steps in Experiment 1: Intensity of Unpolarized Light After Polarization  Place the laser in a holder and place it at the left end of the optics bench, aimed toward the viewing screen at the other end.  Turn on the laser and note the approximate brightness of the spot on the screen. If you have a photometer, measure the intensity of the laser light on the screen.  Place a linear polarizer in front of the laser. If you have a photometer, measure the intensity of the polarized laser light on the screen. Is it what you expect from theory? Observe the laser spot on the screen as you rotate the polarizer in the holder. Record your observations in your lab notebook.   Intensity of Polarized Light After Further Polarization Discussion: For polarized incident light, the intensity of the polarized light that emerges depends on the angle between the initial direction of polarization and the polarizer’s transmission axis. If the relative angle is θ, only the component parallel to the transmission axis will be transmitted. Thus, ET = E0 cosθ, where ET is the transmitted electric field and E0 is the incident electric field. The intensity of light is proportional to the square of the electric field. Therefore, the intensity of the transmitted light is related to the intensity of the incoming polarized light by the following equation: IT= I0 cos2θ This is the Law of Malus. Question 2 If initially unpolarized light passes through one polarizer, and then a second one whose transmission axis is parallel to that of the first one, what will be the final intensity of the light?

If you have a photometer, measure the intensity of the laser light on the screen. Place a second polarizer on the optics bench after the first polarizer. The one closest to the light source is the Polarizer. The second will be called the Analyzer. Initially, let the transmission axis of the Analyzer be parallel to that of the Polarizer. That is, the angle θ = 0. Observe the laser spot on the screen as you rotate the Analyzer. Record your observations in your laboratory notebook. What happens when the transmission axes are at right angles to each other? Why does this occur?

In particular, he was first to explain the reason behind rainbows. Roger Bacon, a philosopher from the 13th century, guessed that the colors of a rainbow are due to the reflection and refraction of sunlight through raindrops, and Newton’s work later confirmed this hypothesis. We now know that the wavelength of a visible electromagnetic wave determines the color that we perceive, but in Newton’s time, scientists believed that white light was colorless, and that the process of passing white light through a glass prism produced the color. Newton's experiments showed that all the colors already existed in the white light, and that \"corpuscles\" (particles) of light were spread out by the prism because particles with different colors traveled at different speeds through the glass. In this lab, you will reproduce Newton’s experiments and refract white light with a prism, resolving it into its component colors: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo and Violet. A mnemonic for the order is our friend, Roy G. Biv.    Equipment White light source (e.g., an incandescent light bulb or sunlight) Two Collimators (a card with a thin slit cut in it, to form the white light into a narrow beam) Viewing screen Two Prisms Colored pencils   Safety Do not look directly into the light source, especially if it is the sun, or cause the beam to be directed or reflected into anyone’s eyes!

If someone needs first aid, notify your instructor immediately. When you have completed an experiment, always dispose of, recycle or store equipment and supplies in their proper location. If in doubt: Ask!   Experiment 1: Splitting White Light into its Component Colors Discussion: Humans perceive different wavelengths of light as different colors. When we see light of a single wavelength, we perceive it as a pure color, such as red, green or violet. The light that comes from the Sun and from incandescent light bulbs, which we see as white light, is actually a mixture of many different wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation. Prisms separate white light into its component wavelengths. Prisms disperse light because the index of refraction depends on the light’s wavelength, so the speed of light waves differs depending on the light’s color. This is called dispersion, or to be more specific, chromatic dispersion, since dispersion can also occur with non-visible electromagnetic radiation and mechanical waves as well.  Steps in Experiment 1: Splitting White Light into its Component Colors  Arrange the light source so that it shines through the collimating slit, so that you have a beam of white light. Let the beam strike one of the triangular faces of the prism at an angle, i.e., not perpendicular to the glass surface. Place the viewing screen at a distance from the prism so that a spectrum is projected onto it. Draw a picture in your lab notebook with colored pencils.   Question When white light hits a prism, the different wavelengths are refracted at different angles, resulting in a rainbow of colors. Look at how the colors of light are ordered on the other side of the prism. Do you think that blue light is bent (“refracted”) more when it enters the glass from air, or do you think that red light is bent more? If light of a certain color bends more, then glass has a relatively large index of refraction for that color.  Experiment 2: Passing a Pure Color through a Prism Question If you place a prism in front of pure red light, what do you think will happen on the other side? Will the intensity change? Will the color change? Hypothesis A hypothesis is a brief statement that describes what you expect your experiment to show. State your hypothesis for the question above. Steps in Experiment 2: Passing a Pure Color through a Prism  Arrange the light source so that it shines through the collimating slit, so that you have a beam of white light. Let the beam strike one of the triangular faces of the prism at an angle, i.e., not perpendicular to the glass surface.

High voltage is applied to a wire running along the axis of the low-pressure gas chamber, while the cylindrical conducting wall is grounded. A thin window at the bottom of the chamber (generally made of mica) allows penetrating radiation to ionize atoms of the gas mixture. Electrons drift to the center and positive ions drift to the wall. The resulting electrical pulse is amplified and sent to an electronic counter. Alpha and beta particles are charged and interact directly with atoms in the gas mixture. Gamma rays (high energy photons) are uncharged and are detected when they strike the chamber wall.    Equipment Radiation monitor and power supply and electronic counter  Radioactive sources (alpha, beta, or gamma sources)  Tube stand and sample holder  Lead bricks or other radioactive shielding  Stopwatch  Micrometer  Aluminum foil or other pieces of foil or sheet metal    Safety Wear disposable gloves when handling the sources.

If someone needs first aid, notify your instructor immediately. When you have completed an experiment, always dispose of, recycle, or store equipment and supplies in their proper locations. If in doubt: Ask!   Experiment 1: Plotting the Geiger Plateau Discussion In this experiment, you will determine the best operating voltage for your GM tube. If a radioactive sample is placed under the tube and the voltage is slowly increased, no counts at all will be detected until the tube reaches its starting potential. After that, a slight increase in voltage will result in a rapid increase in count rate. This voltage is known as the threshold. As the voltage is increased past the threshold, the counting rate will stay fairly constant over a range of voltages. This region of operating voltage is known as the Geiger plateau. If the voltage is turned too high, past the plateau, the tube is in “continuous discharge” mode and will be ruined quickly. Steps in Experiment 1: Geiger Plateau  Turn on the instrument with the voltage set as low as possible, and allow it to warm up for the amount of time specified by the manufacturer.  Place a prepared beta source into the tube stand below the GM tube. Reset the instrument so that the counts are at zero. Observe and record the number of counts per minute at the lowest voltage. Plot the counts per minute vs. voltage as you proceed, so that you can see the shape of the graph as it develops. Increase the voltage by 25 or 50 volts, and try again. In order to prevent continuous discharge, do not let the count rate rise more than 10% above the plateau value. Determine the best operating voltage for the tube. The “best” voltage to operate at is chosen within the plateau, generally in the lower 1/4 of it, which helps preserve tube life.   Experiment 2: Background Radiation On Earth, we are constantly being exposed to a wide variety of natural radiation. Sources include cosmic rays and radioactive atoms in our bodies, our food, and our environment. This radiation adds to the count that we record from a sample, so it causes us to overcount activity, especially when the sample activity is not very high.  To make accurate measurements, we must determine the background count and correct our data for it. Experimental Design How might you design an experiment to measure the background count? Steps in Experiment 2: Background Radiation  Prepare the radiation counter as in the previous experiment. No sources will be used in this experiment; make sure they are kept far away from the radiation counter. Observe and record the counts for three 5-minute long data runs with no shielding around the GM tube. Now place some lead bricks around the tube so that it is shielded completely from background radiation. Observe and record the counts for three 5-minute long data runs with lead shielding around the GM tube. Convert the observed activities to counts per minute and find the average of your 3 trials in each case. How much is the background radiation reduced by the shielding?    Experiment 3: Measuring Shelf Ratios Radiation exits a source in all directions, but only a small fraction is detected by the radiation counter. This fraction depends on R, the distance from the point source of radiation to the GM tube. If the source is moved farther from the GM tube, the amount of radiation being counted will roughly follow an inverse square relationship. Sometimes, if a source is too active, it is placed on a lower shelf of the tube stand, or if it is very weak, it is placed on a higher shelf closer to the tube to obtain a suitable counting rate. However, if we wish to compare the activities of 2 samples that were not measured on the same shelf, it becomes necessary to measure the shelf ratio so that we can make an accurate comparison. In this experiment, we explore the effect of distance upon the intensity of radiation and measure the shelf ratios of a sample holder.  Steps in Experiment 3: Measuring Shelf Ratios  Prepare the radiation counter as in the previous experiments. Take a background count and record it. Only one source at a time will be used in this experiment; make sure all others are kept far away from the radiation counter. Place the radioactive sample on shelf #1, the highest shelf, which is closest to the detector. Determine the number of counts per minute (cpm). Make sure to correct the raw data by subtracting the background count. Move the sample down to shelf #2 and repeat step #19. Move the sample down another shelf and repeat until you have data for each of the shelves. Assign to shelf #1 a shelf ratio of 1.00. Calculate the shelf ratios for the other shelves by dividing the cpm for shelf #1 into the cpm for each of the other shelves.  If you have time, measure the shelf ratios for another radioactive source. Did it depend upon the identity of the sample used?   Experiment 4: Absorption of Beta Particles Discussion A beta particle is identical to an electron, except that it is emitted from a radioactive nucleus. Beta particles are emitted from radioactive sources with a wide range of energies.  Steps in Experiment 4: Absorption of Beta Particles  Prepare the radiation counter as in the previous experiments. Take a background count and record it. Only one source at a time will be used in this experiment; make sure all others are kept far away from the radiation counter. Place the beta sample on shelf #2 or 3. Determine the number of counts per minute (cpm). Make sure to correct the raw data by subtracting the background count. Place the thinnest absorber in the shelf just above it. Measure the thickness using your micrometer. Determine the number of counts per minute (cpm) with this absorber. Make sure to correct the raw data by subtracting the background count. Repeat with the other absorbers, going from thinnest to thickest.

Steps in Experiment 1: Frequency and Wavelength 1.Prepare the lab equipment per the vendor’s instructions with water and the plane wave generator. Your instructor may tell you how much water to pour into the ripple tank, and you can measure this amount using a graduated cylinder.  2.Turn on the ripple generator, and set frequency to approximately 10 Hz (that is, 10 times per second). Record the frequency. 3.In order to “freeze” the action and make it easier to see what is happening, set the light to “strobe” at approximately the same frequency as the wave generator.  4.Measure the distance between peaks in the water wave; this is the wavelength. 5.Change the frequency several times, and repeat the experiment. 6.Note the relationship between frequency and the distance between wave peaks (wavelength). Hint: try multiplying them together. 7.(optional) Change the water depth and repeat the experiment.   Frequency, f (Hz)Wavelength, λ (m)Product, λf (m/s)  Trial #1       Trial #2       Trial #3        Reflection Discussion: Waves reflect—that is, bounce off a surface. In this part of the lab, you will analyze the relationship of the angle of the incident (incoming) wave and the angle of the reflected wave. If you are not familiar with incident and reflected waves and reflection, please consult the textbook. They are explained below but the textbook covers them in more depth.  Steps in Experiment 2: Reflection 8.Prepare the lab equipment per the vendor’s instructions with water and the plane wave generator. Your instructor may tell you how much water to pour into the ripple  tank, and you can measure this amount using a graduated cylinder.  9.Place a barrier at an angle to the plane wave generator. 10.On the paper below the tank, trace out a line immediately below the barrier and parallel to it. 11.Next, draw a line that shows the direction from the ripple wave generator to the barrier. In other words, trace the direction of the incident wave. This line should intersect the previous one; call that point W.  12.Turn on the ripple generator, and set frequency to approximately 18 Hz (that is, 18 times per second). 13.In order to “freeze” the action and make it easier to see what is happening, set the light to “strobe” at approximately the same frequency as the wave generator.  14.Place a ruler that is parallel to the direction in which the reflected waves are traveling. That line should start at point W. Now, the two “wave” lines show where a part of the incident wave reaches the barrier at point W, and how the wave reflects off the barrier.  15.Turn off the equipment. 16.Change the paper if necessary, and repeat with the barrier set at two different angles. 17.A “normal” line is perpendicular to another line. Draw a line normal to the barrier line, starting at point W. The normal line should fall between the incident and reflected wave lines.  18.Using a protractor, measure the incident and reflected angles. They are the angles between the incident line and the normal line and the reflected line and the normal line, respectively.    Incident angleReflected angle  Barrier at angle 1     Barrier at angle 2     Barrier at angle 3     What relationship do you observe between the angles?  Diffraction Discussion: Waves diffract—that is, spread out—as they pass through a slit that is narrow relative to their wavelength. Plane waves become circular wave fronts. This experiment shows a relationship between the width of the diffraction patterns and the size of the slit.  Steps in Experiment 3: Diffraction and Interference, Part I 19.Place the wave generator at the back edge of the ripple tank. 20.Pour a small amount of water in the tank. Your instructor may tell you how much water to pour into the ripple tank, and you can measure this amount using a graduated cylinder.  21.Level the tank. 22.Place two long barriers on a line within the tank so they have a 2.5 centimeter gap between their ends. The barriers should be aligned parallel to the plane wave generator (i.e., so that the incoming plane waves pass through the gap) and 5 centimeters from the generator.  23.Trace the outlines of the long barriers on the paper below the tank. 24.Turn on the generator. 25.In order to “freeze” the action and make it easier to see what is happening, set the light to “strobe” at approximately the same frequency as the wave generator.  26.Sketch the wave fronts before they reach the slits and after they pass through. 27.Turn off the equipment. 28.Repeat the experiment with the barriers separated by 1.25 centimeters. 29.Turn off the equipment. 30.Repeat the experiment with the barriers separated by 1.25 centimeters, but increase the wave frequency until you notice a difference in wavelength and the angle at which the waves spread out after they pass through the barrier.  Questions How is the angle at which the waves spread out related to the width of the single slit (i.e., the distance between the barriers)? How is the angle at which the waves spread out related to the wavelength (i.e., the distance between the wave fronts)? How is the angle at which the waves spread out related to the frequency? Steps in Experiment 4: Diffraction and Interference, Part 2 In this part, you create two slits. 31.Place a short barrier between two long barriers, with all barriers parallel to the wave generator. Create two small gaps with the centers 2 centimeters apart.  32.Sketch the setup on the paper below the tank. 33.Turn on the generator. 34.Sketch the wave fronts. Locate the points where waves tend to constructively interfere and where they cancel out. In other words, locate the maximum and minimum points. You will see that the waves tend to spread out after they pass through the 2 slits.  35.Repeat the experiment with a different spacing between the centers of the 2 slits. 36.Now, keeping the spacing between the slits the same, repeat the experiment with a different wave generator frequency and wavelength.  Questions How is the angle at which the waves spread out related to the distance between the slits? When the frequency increases (and wavelength decreases), what happens to the way in which the waves spread out after passing through the slits?

Tuning forks are labeled with the frequency they generate. Using resonance and a tuning fork, you can determine both the frequency and wavelength of a sound wave. Since wave speed is the product of frequency and wavelength, you can determine the speed of sound in air. Resonance tubes can be as simple as a plastic tube being dipped into water in a graduated cylinder, or as complicated as a dedicated expanding cardboard tube from a physics equipment supplier. We will describe the experimental procedure using the former method, but if you have a resonance tube, the procedure is very similar. Sound is a wave. As your textbook discusses, reflecting waves interfere. If they interfere constructively, they get louder. An acoustic wave will constructively interfere with a closed air column at specific fractions of its wavelength, namely at 1/4, 3/4, and 5/4, etc. of its wavelength. When the air column’s length equals these fractions of the sound’s wavelength, the sound produced by a tuning fork held above such an air column will become louder.    Equipment Tuning forks Meterstick (metric ruler) Tall graduated cylinder, 50 cm or longer (or unmarked clear tube of that length) PVC (or other pipe) with an inner diameter of at least 3 cm (if you are using a cylinder) and 50 cm or longer. The outside diameter of the pipe needs to be narrower than the inside diameter of the graduated cylinder. Optional: A resonance tube may be used in place of the previous 2 items.   Safety The vibrations of tuning forks can damage or shatter plastic and glass tubes. Do not touch the tube or the graduated cylinder with the vibrating turning fork!  General Lab Safety: Observe all procedures detailed by your instructor. Keep a clean and orderly work space. If you break or spill something, notify your instructor immediately. If someone needs first aid, notify your instructor immediately. When you have completed an experiment, always dispose of, recycle, or store equipment and supplies in their proper locations. If in doubt: Ask!   Design an Experiment How can you use the PVC pipe and the tall cylinder of water to create air columns of different heights? Try to design this part of your experiment before you read onward. By vibrating a tuning fork above a column of air whose height is variable, you can search for resonances, when the sound suddenly gets louder. This will allow you to determine the wavelength of the sound wave. Given what you know about the relationship of wavelength, frequency, and wave speed, how can you calculate the speed of sound in air? Try to complete the design of your experiment before you read onward. Identify the Variables What are all the variables that you will have to measure in order to find the speed of sound in air? Explain. What letters will you use to represent each of these physical quantities? Is there other information or equipment that you will need to make a more accurate measurement? Explain, referring to diagrams if necessary.  Steps in the Experiment  Partially fill a graduated cylinder with water. You do not want it to overflow when the PVC pipe is placed in it. Place the PVC pipe into the graduated cylinder. Note the height of the air column above the water. Begin with the PVC pipe almost all the way down, so as to have a short air column (about 10 cm).  Use a tuning fork with a known frequency. Strike the tuning fork. Place it above the PVC pipe so that the tines vibrate vertically, parallel to the axis of the pipe.  Raise the pipe and the tuning fork together until the sound clearly becomes louder. This is the fundamental node, or the first harmonic. At this point, the length of the air column is 1/4 the wavelength. (Note: It should be on the order of 20 to 30 centimeters).  Measure this length in meters. Keep raising the pipe and fork so there is a taller column of air between its top and the water in the cylinder. When the sound again becomes louder, you have found the second harmonic. At this point, the length of the air column is 3/4 the wavelength. Keep raising the pipe and fork so there is a taller column of air between its top and the water in the cylinder. When the sound again becomes louder, you have found the third harmonic. At this point, the length of the air column is 5/4 the wavelength.  Fill in the table below. Multiply the length of the air column by the appropriate fraction to calculate the wavelength of the sound wave for different harmonics.  If you have multiple tuning forks, complete the table for 2 or 3 frequencies. For a fixed frequency, all of the wavelength measurements should be the same.    NotesFrequency, f(Hz)HarmonicLength of air column(m)Wavelength, λ(m)        Question 1 Will the product of frequency and wavelength for a sound wave be constant? Explain. Hypothesis A hypothesis is a brief statement that describes what you expect your experiment to show. State your hypothesis for the question above. To check your answer, add a column to your table showing the product of frequency and wavelength for each of your trials. What is your determination of the speed of sound in air?  Question 2 What might be some sources of error in the lab (comparing your measured speed of sound to the standard value for the speed of sound, as reported in the textbook)?  Analyze Your Results Is Your Data Reasonable? In order to determine if your data is reasonable, consider the following questions: You may know the old rule of thumb to determine how far away a lightning flash is: Watch the sky for a flash of lightning, count the number of seconds until you hear thunder, and divide the number of seconds by 3 to calculate the distance in kilometers. Is your value for the speed of sound roughly consistent with this rule of thumb?  If you have calculated any values, are those values reasonable based on the data used for the calculation? Are you getting the same general results as other lab groups are getting? If the answer to any question above is “no,” it does NOT mean your lab results are wrong. But you may want to try to retake some measurements, for example, remeasuring the current through a resistor, to see if you get the same results as before.  Determine Sources of Uncertainty In every experiment there are potential sources of error, and/or instances of a lack of accuracy and precision. Explain what sources of error or lack of accuracy and precision might be in this lab.  Form Your Conclusion Think Critically  If your experiment proved your hypothesis, your conclusion is merely a restatement of your hypothesis. If your experiment did not prove your hypothesis, you may have to design another experiment and form a new hypothesis based on your experimental data.

In this experiment, you will photograph a ball in flight using a stroboscope and a digital camera. The strobe effect will result in a succession of images being recorded on the photograph at equal time intervals. At each time increment, the ball's position (x and y coordinates) will be measured directly from the digital photograph.

If someone needs first aid, notify your instructor immediately. When you have completed an experiment, always dispose of, recycle, or store equipment and supplies in their proper locations. If in doubt: Ask!   Discussion Your textbook will contain background information about projectile motion. In brief, the equations for an object undergoing motion with a constant acceleration a in one dimension are:       (1) and      (2) where d is the position at time t, v is the velocity at time t, di is the initial position and vi is the initial velocity. In projectile motion, these relations are applied to each direction (horizontal and vertical) separately. Question What is the acceleration a, when considering the horizontal motion? What about vertical motion? Hypothesis A hypothesis is a brief statement that describes what you expect your experiment to show. State your hypothesis for the question above. Steps in the Experiment  Set up the launcher, meterstick, camera, and stroboscope so as to photograph the flight of the ball against a black background. The plumb line should be in the photo so that the direction of true vertical may be determined. The meterstick should be in the frame of the photo and parallel to the plumb line, so that you can translate the “photographic” coordinates to “real-life” coordinates.  Keep the shutter of the camera open for 2-5 seconds for optimal results. Ensure that the exit ramp of the launcher is horizontal. Set the strobe to flash at a rate of 30 flashes/sec. This means that successive images of the ball on your photograph will be separated by 1/30 of a second.  With the lights out and the stroboscope flashing, one student pushes the shutter button. Another student releases the ball immediately after the shutter button is pressed. You will see the captured image on the camera display. You should have a photograph with approximately 10 images of the ball, separated in time by 1/30 of a second.    Discussion and Analysis On the computer, open the photo with Paint®, and rotate the photograph using the software until the plumb line is vertical.  Find the scale factor of your photo. To do so, place the computer cursor on two points on the meterstick that are visible in the photograph. You can read off the “pixel coordinates” from the computer program. Since you know the “real-life” separation of the two selected points, you now have a scale factor that will allow you to translate pixel coordinates to real-life x-y coordinates. For example, if 0.30 m on the meter stick corresponds to 3000 pixels on the photograph, then your scale factor is 0.30m/3000 pixels = 1E-4 meters/pixel. Enlarge the photo enough so that you can see the white dots corresponding to the images of the ball. Place the cursor over each dot and read the coordinates displayed in the lower right corner of the Paint® window. Record these coordinates as “X(pixels)” and “Y(pixels).” Convert them to real-life coordinates by multiplying by the scale factor you determined earlier. Let t = 0 correspond to the location of the first image of the ball. Make a graph of x versus t and do a straight line fit. Question Why should this be a straight line? What is the interpretation of the slope? Hypothesis A hypothesis is a brief statement that describes what you expect your experiment to show. State your hypothesis for the question above. Now consider the y-values. Calculate the average velocity in the y direction for each interval of 1/15 sec; for example, for the interval between position 3 and position 5, the average velocity in the y direction is .Do this for each point in your data table. If the acceleration is constant, the average velocity that you calculate in this way is equal to the instantaneous velocity at t4. Calculate the instantaneous y-velocity for each of the times in your experiment (except for the first and the last). Make a plot of vy vs. t and do a straight line fit.  Question Why should this be a straight line? What is the interpretation of the slope? Can you check the slope of your line and find the percentage deviation from a “true value”?

Hypothesis A hypothesis is a brief statement that describes what you expect your experiment to show. State your hypothesis for the question above.  Steps in the Experiment  Connecting 3 or 4 slinky springs together with wire to form a long chain may make the experiment more effective, but even 1 will work.  You and a lab partner hold different ends of the spring. Shake it up and down. You and a lab partner hold different ends of the spring. Push it toward and away from each other.    Question 2 What is the relationship between power and frequency? In other words, if you double the frequency at which you shake the end of the spring, are you supplying the same amount of power to do this as before, twice as much, or more? In your experiment, you will estimate the results.  Hypothesis A hypothesis is a brief statement that describes what you expect your experiment to show. For example, in this case, you want to decide if the momentum of each object will increase, decrease, or remain the same after a collision. State your hypothesis for the question above. Steps in the Experiment  Trying generating a wave at twice the frequency. If you have a stroboscope, set it and shake the spring so that a marked location on your spring reaches its endpoint of motion exactly when the light flashes. Then double the frequency of the stroboscope, and again attempt to have the same marked location on the spring reach its peak exactly when the light flashes. Alternatively, you may use a metronome and try to hit the peak with each “tick” that you hear.  Estimate how much more power you and your partner are supplying.    Question 3 Is there a relationship between amplitude and frequency? Hypothesis A hypothesis is a brief statement that describes what you expect your experiment to show. For example, in this case, you want to decide if the momentum of each object will increase, decrease, or remain the same after a collision. State your hypothesis for the question above. Steps in the Experiment  If you do not have a wave motion rope, use a slinky spring. To create greater amplitude, do you have to increase the frequency? If you have wave motion rope equipment, can you increase the frequency without increasing the amplitude? Can you increase the amplitude without increasing the frequency?     Question 4 Is there a relationship between frequency and wavelength for waves moving at the same speed? Hypothesis State your hypothesis for the question above.  Steps in the Experiment  If you do not have a wave motion rope, use a slinky spring. If you increase the frequency, does either the wave speed or wavelength change? Can you increase the frequency without altering either the wave speed or the wavelength?  Try to create a wave with a constant speed (a rope may be useful here). If you increase the frequency, what must happen to the wavelength for the speed of the wave to stay roughly constant?  If you have a wave motion rope, alter the frequency and observe what happens to the wavelength or wave speed.    Question 5 What happens when two waves collide and interfere with each other? Hypothesis State your hypothesis for the question above.  Steps in the Experiment  Two partners hold different ends of the rope. First, one partner shakes an end of the rope. Then, both do so simultaneously. A third student should inspect the amplitude of the combined wave when two “hills” meet each other, when two “valleys” meet, and when a hill meets a valley.

Do not place your hands in the equipment unless it is turned off and/or the batteries are removed. Turn off the equipment before you load the projectile.   Demonstration 1 Letting the cart move horizontally at constant velocity, ask students where they expect the ball to land relative to the cart. Give the cart different initial horizontal velocities. One method to measure the constant horizontal velocity of the ball and the cart is for you to lay a meterstick parallel to the cart’s path and use a stopwatch to determine how long it takes the cart to cover a certain distance. Use a scientific calculator to divide the distance by the elapsed time. Another method to measure the cart’s constant horizontal velocity is to attach a horizontal flag to the side of the cart. When the flag passes through a photogate, the light will be blocked for a certain time interval, as recorded by your computer. Divide the flag length by the time interval to find the cart’s horizontal velocity. Steps in the Experiment  Consult the instruction manual for detailed instructions on configuring the ballistics cart. Make sure the battery is installed. If your ballistic cart comes in several pieces, attach the “shoots projectile” apparatus securely to the “rolling cart.” Fire an object into the air to ensure the cart is firing straight up. Put the photogate trip bracket near the end of the track. Push the cart firmly. Catch the cart so it doesn’t go off the end of the track. Observe the landing location of the ball. Give the cart three different initial velocities.   Demonstration 2 If the ball does not land exactly on the cart, ask students about the real-world factors that might cause it not to land there.   Demonstration 3 If you have digital video analysis equipment, determine and compare the initial horizontal velocities of the ball and the cart. If they differ at all, explain why they might.   Demonstration 4 Attach a string to the front of the ballistic cart so that the string can pass over a pulley with table clamp, to a mass hanger with slotted masses. The tension in the string will cause the ballistic cart to accelerate.  One method to measure the cart’s acceleration is to attach a paper tape to the rear of the ballistic cart, and use carbon paper and a ticker timer to make marks on the paper tape. From the marks, you will be able to determine the linear acceleration of the ballistic cart.  An alternate method to measure the cart’s acceleration is to use a data acquisition probe, such as an ultrasonic motion sensor, to measure the position, velocity and/or acceleration of the cart over time.  Now ask the students where they expect the ball to land relative to the cart. Perform several trials.   Demonstration 5 Let the ballistic cart roll down an inclined plane, and let the trigger launch the ball while the cart is accelerating down the plane. Remind the students that the ball is launched straight up relative to the cart. Now, ask them where they expect the ball to land relative to the cart.

Discussion Momentum is conserved in any collision, inelastic or elastic, when no net external forces act. The initial momentum of the system is mv. We use lowercase letters for the mass and velocity of the ball. Immediately after the collision, the momentum is (m + M)V. We use uppercase letters for the mass of the pendulum and its velocity.We can write an equation for the velocity of the pendulum and ball immediately after the collision. mv = (m + M)V We can solve this equation for the initial velocity of the ball:  There is some energy loss during the totally inelastic collision, but immediately after the collision, energy is conserved. Both the ball and the pendulum are moving at velocity V. At the peak of the motion, all the mechanical energy is in gravitational potential energy. The variable h represents how high the combined ball/pendulum rises.   Solve the second equation for the velocity of the pendulum plus ball immediately after the collision.

Use insulated tools to connect wires and electrical components in a circuit. Remember, even low voltage can cause injury.   Demonstration 1: Design, Build, and Analyze a Series Circuit Question(s) for Students Here, you will consider the relationship of current, potential difference, and power for components or different resistances connected in series. The following questions should guide your experimental design. Does the same amount of current flow through components connected in series? Or is it a function of the resistance of the component? Is the potential difference measured across each of the components going to be the same when they are connected in series? Or is it a function of the resistance of the component?

Steps in Demonstration 1:  Arrange two identical mini-lightbulbs so that they are in a series combination. The circuit should be powered by a battery or by a DC power supply. Build a knife switch into your circuit so that current will flow only when the switch is closed. This will help keep the battery from being drained when you are not actively taking measurements. Measure and compare the current in each of the bulbs to the total current entering the combination. Measure and compare the voltage across each of the bulbs to the total voltage across the combination. From the previous measurements, verify the resistance of each bulb. (Note: the resistance of the bulb may change when the filament is cold compared to when it is hot, which may result in some error.) Use the multimeter to measure the total resistance of the combination. Calculate the electric power consumed by each bulb. Power equals the product of current and voltage. Calculate the total power consumed by the combination. If desired, repeat the previous steps using resistors instead of lightbulbs.

Measuring the Kinetic Friction Coefficient Question(s) for the Students For contact between wood and the table surface, would you expect mK to be approximately independent of the normal force and the speed?  Steps in Demonstration 1: Kinetic Friction Coefficient and Normal Force and Speed    Set up the apparatus so that the friction block slides along a horizontal track, pulled by a string that passes over a pulley with table clamp. If the block moves at constant velocity, then the tension in the string equals the kinetic frictional force.  Place the larger wooden side of the friction block facing down toward the table, and add 500 g of mass on top of it.  Run the string from the friction block over the pulley and down to the hanging mass hanger with slotted or hooked masses. Use a spring scale or a triple beam balance to measure the total mass.  An ultrasonic motion sensor monitors the velocity of the friction block as a function of time.  Add some mass on the hanging mass holder, and tap the friction block so that it starts slowly moving along the track. Collect data for the velocity as a function of time. Adjust the hanging mass until the graph of velocity vs. time is a horizontal line, indicating constant velocity.  If desired, add some mass to the top of the friction block and repeat, until you have 3 trials in all.  For each trial, calculate the normal force, the tension in the string, and then the coefficient of kinetic friction between the two surfaces.       Question(s) for the Students Would you expect mK to be approximately independent of contact area?  Steps in Demonstration 2: Kinetic Friction Coefficient and Area of Contact    Repeat steps 1-7, placing the narrow wooden surface on the table.     Question(s) for the Students For contact between felt and the table surface, would you expect mK to be larger or smaller than between wood and the table surface?  Steps in Demonstration 3: Kinetic Friction Coefficient and Materials    Repeat steps 1-7, placing a wide or narrow felt surface on the table. Compare the results to those obtained between wood and the table surface.      Measuring the Static Friction Coefficient Question(s) for the Students You can use a friction block on an inclined plane to calculate the coefficient of static friction between two materials. As the plane is inclined more and more from the horizontal, at some point the block just begins to slide. At that moment, what is the relationship between the static friction coefficient and the angle of inclination of the plane from the horizontal?  Steps in Demonstration 4: Static Friction Coefficient    Place the friction block on an inclined plane.  Measure the angle of inclination, using a protractor or by using trigonometry.  Incline the plane until the force of gravity just overcomes friction and causes the friction block to slide.  Now, repeat the experiment and incline it just a hair less. The plane is now at the angle at which the maximum force of static friction just balances the component of the block’s weight that is directed down the plane.  At this point, the static friction is at its maximum. The tangent of the angle of inclination of the plane is the coefficient of static friction.

Steps in Demonstration 1: Computing the focal length with a faraway object  Mount the lens on the optics bench, and place the viewing screen on the same bench. By sliding the screen back and forth relative to the lens, focus the image of a distant bright object, such as a window, onto the screen. Measure the distance from the lens to the screen. This is the image distance. Ask the students to use the thin lens equation with an object at infinity to calculate the lens’s focal length.

Have a student stand in front of a full-length plane mirror. Start with the toes. Have a second student raise the ruler until it reaches the height on the mirror at which the first student sees her toes. In other words, the second student raises the ruler from the bottom of the mirror until it reaches the height at which it will block the first student’s view of her own toes.

The standard equation for a linear fit is y = m×x + b, where m is the slope and b is the y intercept. In this case, the slope of the position data, which is the derivative of the linear function, represents the velocity.   Experiment 2: A toy moving with constant acceleration Question(s) for Students If a small toy car moves with constant acceleration, what will its position vs. time graph look like? What about its velocity vs. time graph? What about its acceleration vs. time graph? If the plane is inclined at an angle of θ off the horizontal, what is the expected acceleration of the toy car down the plane? Assume that it moves just like a frictionless object sliding down the inclined plane.  Steps in Demonstration 2: A toy moving with constant acceleration  Set up an inclined plane by putting a small object under one end of a flat board or something similar. Measure the angle of inclination from the horizontal using a protractor, or by making linear measurements and using trigonometry. Set up the data acquisition sensor as before, only now, clamp the motion sensor with the ring stand, clamps, and 90-degree clamps so that it points down the inclined plane, parallel to its surface. Start the computer program and ask it to display graphs of position, velocity, and acceleration against time. Set the toy car at the top of the inclined plane, about 10 cm in front of the motion sensor. Let go of the car and start taking data. You may hear a clicking noise from the ultrasonic sensor. Choose your best run for further analysis. To curve fit the data, click the \"Fit\" icon located just above the graph, with a \"Linear Fit\" option if the data points fall on a straight line, or a “Quadratic Fit” or “second-degree fit” if the data points fall on a parabola (a special kind of curve). The program will display information about the best fit through your data. By looking at the parameters of your best fit lines and parabolas, you will be able to determine the acceleration of the car. How do the numbers compare to what you expect from theory?

Discussion A mass on the end of a string is an example of a simple pendulum. If the mass is displaced from the vertical equilibrium position and then released, it will execute simple harmonic motion (approximately) with a period T of  where L is the length of the pendulum, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. A detailed analysis will show that the period actually increases very slightly as the amplitude increases. Fortunately, if the amplitude is kept to a few degrees, the formula above is accurate to better than 0.1%. You don't have to measure the amplitude accurately: just keep the amplitude fairly small.  Question(s) for Students Re-arrange the equation above to show that the square of the period is proportional to the length of the pendulum. What is the constant of proportionality?  Steps in the Experiment  Create a Data Collection Chart  Column 1: Length of the pendulum (m) Column 2: Period of oscillation (s) Attach the top end of the string to the pendulum support. Attach the smallest mass to the lower end of the string, and adjust the support so that L is about a meter. Carefully measure L from the top of the string to the center of the mass. Start the pendulum swinging with a small amplitude, and measure the period by timing 10 full oscillations with a stopwatch (don’t forget to divide the total time by 10). Repeat the previous 2 steps for five more values of L, down to about half a meter. Make a graph of T2 (vertical axis) vs. L (horizontal axis). Determine the slope of your best line through the data. This slope should correspond to 4Π2/g. From your slope, solve for g. Calculate the percentage error relative to the accepted value of 9.80 m/s2.  Question(s) for Students Does the period depend on the mass? Uncertainty in measured data For a single value of L, and a single swing, have several students measure T with a stopwatch, for one back and forth swing of the pendulum. Is there a relatively large “spread” in the results? To quantify the “spread”, calculate the standard deviation of the different measurements. Identify the causes of the uncertainty in the measured data. What are some reasons that the students got different results? Didn’t they all measure the same thing? Identify the effects of the uncertainty in the measured data. If you use the lowest value of T in the equation that relates T, L, and g, what value of g do you obtain? What happens if you use the highest value of T that was measured? Quantify the causes of the uncertainty in the measured data. How confident are you in the result of the experiment of measuring the time for one back and forth swing? Are you sure that your result is accurate to within, say, 1 second? How about 0.5 seconds? (Hint: you may want to do some experiments regarding human reaction time.) For the same value of L, now have different students measure T with a stopwatch, for 10 back and forth swings of the pendulum (and then dividing the total time by 10). Is there a smaller “spread” in the results? To quantify the “spread”, calculate the standard deviation of the different measurements. Now that you each have measured T using 10 complete swings, if you use the lowest value of T in the equation that relates T, L, and g, what value of g do you obtain? What happens if you use the highest value of T that your group measured? Comment on the advantages and disadvantages of making measurements of 10 periods vs. making just one.

Intensity of Unpolarized Light After Polarization Question for the Students If you place a linear polarizer in front of unpolarized light, it is half as intense on the other side. What do you think will happen to the brightness if the linear polarizer is rotated? Will the intensity change? Steps in Demonstration 1: Intensity of Unpolarized Light After Polarization  Place the laser in a holder and place it at the left end of the optics bench, aimed toward the viewing screen at the other end. Turn on the laser and note the approximate brightness of the spot on the screen. If you have a photometer, measure the intensity of the laser light on the screen. Place a linear polarizer in front of the laser. If you have a photometer, measure the intensity of the polarized laser light on the screen. It should be half of what it was before.

Demonstration 1: Plotting the Geiger Plateau Steps in Demonstration 1: Geiger Plateau  Turn on the instrument with the voltage set as low as possible, and allow it to warm up for the amount of time specified by the manufacturer. Place a prepared source, (204Tl or another beta emitter) into the tube stand below the GM tube. Reset the instrument so that the counts are at zero. Observe and record the number of counts per minute at the lowest voltage. Plot the counts per minute vs. voltage as you proceed, so that you can see the shape of the graph as it develops. Increase the voltage by 25 or 50 volts, and try again. In order to prevent continuous discharge, do not let the count rate rise more than 10% above the plateau value. Determine the best operating voltage for the tube. The “best” voltage to operate at is chosen within the plateau, generally in the lower 1/4 of it, which helps preserve tube life.

Equipment Ripple tank Ripple (wave) generator Stroboscope Water Graduated cylinder Meterstick (metric ruler) Protractor   Safety Ripple tanks contain complex equipment, and the overall system combines water and electricity. Be careful and follow instructions carefully to avoid hazards.    Steps in Experiment 1: Frequency and Wavelength   Prepare the lab equipment per the vendor’s instructions with water and the plane wave generator. Turn on the ripple generator, and set frequency to approximately 10 Hz (that is, 10 times per second). Record the frequency. In order to “freeze” the action and make it easier to see what is happening, set the light to “strobe” at approximately the same frequency as the wave generator.     Measure the distance between peaks in the water wave; this is the wavelength. Change the frequency several times, and repeat the experiment. Ask the students to find the relationship between frequency and wavelength. You may give a hint that they should look at the product of the two (which is a constant, the wave speed). (optional) Change the water depth and repeat the experiment. Water waves travel at different speeds, depending on the depth of the water.   Steps in Experiment 2: Reflection   Prepare the lab equipment per the vendor’s instructions with water and the plane wave generator. Place a barrier at an angle to the plane wave generator. On the paper below the tank, trace out a line immediately below the barrier and parallel to it. Next, draw a line that shows the direction from the ripple wave generator to the barrier. In other words, trace the direction of the incident wave. This line should intersect the previous one; call that point W. Turn on the ripple generator, and set frequency to approximately 18 Hz (that is, 18 times per second). In order to “freeze” the action and make it easier to see what is happening, set the light to “strobe” at approximately the same frequency as the wave generator. Place a ruler that is parallel to the direction in which the reflected waves are traveling. That line should start at point W. Now, the two “wave” lines show where a part of the incident wave reaches the barrier at point W and how the wave reflects off of the barrier. Turn off the equipment. Change the paper if necessary, and repeat with the barrier set at two different angles. A “normal” line is perpendicular to another line. Draw a line normal to the barrier line, starting at point W. The normal line should fall between the incident and reflected wave lines. Using a protractor, measure the incident and reflected angles. They should be the same.    Steps in Experiment 3: Diffraction and Interference, Part I   Place the wave generator at the back edge of the ripple tank. Pour a small amount of water into the tank. Your instructor may tell you how much water to pour into the ripple tank, and you can measure this amount using a graduated cylinder. Level the tank. Place two long barriers on a line within the tank so they have a 2.5 centimeter gap between their ends. The barriers should be aligned parallel to the plane wave generator (i.e., so that the incoming plane waves pass through the gap) and 5 centimeters from the generator. Trace the outlines of the long barriers on the paper below the tank. Turn on the generator. In order to “freeze” the action and make it easier to see what is happening, set the light to “strobe” at approximately the same frequency as the wave generator. Sketch the wave fronts before they reach the slits and after they pass through. Turn off the equipment. Repeat the experiment with the barriers separated by 1.25 centimeters. Turn off the equipment. Repeat the experiment with the barriers separated by 1.25 centimeters, but increase the wave frequency until you notice a difference in wavelength and the angle at which the waves spread out after they pass through the barrier.   Questions for Students How is the angle at which the waves spread out related to the width of the single slit (i.e., the distance between the barriers)? How is the angle at which the waves spread out related to the wavelength (i.e., the distance between the wave fronts)? How is the angle at which the waves spread out related to the frequency?  Steps in Experiment 4: Diffraction and Interference, Part 2 In this part, you create two slits.  Place a short barrier between two long barriers, with all barriers parallel to the wave generator. Create two small gaps, with the centers 2 centimeters apart. Sketch the setup on the paper below the tank. Turn on the generator. Sketch the wave fronts. Locate the points where waves tend to constructively interfere and where they cancel out. In other words, locate the maximum and minimum points. You will see that the waves tend to spread out after they pass through the 2 slits.  Repeat the experiment with a different spacing between the centers of the 2 slits. Now, keeping the spacing between the slits the same, repeat the experiment with a different wave generator frequency and wavelength.    Questions for Students How is the angle at which the waves spread out related to the distance between the slits? When the frequency increases (and wavelength decreases), what happens to the way in which the waves spread out after passing through the slits?

Tuning forks are labeled with the frequency they generate. Using resonance and a tuning fork, you can determine both the frequency and wavelength of a sound wave. Since wave speed is the product of frequency and wavelength, you can determine the speed of sound in air. Resonance tubes can be as simple as a plastic tube being dipped into water in a graduated cylinder, or as complicated as a dedicated expanding cardboard tube from a physics equipment supplier. We will describe the experimental procedure using the former method, but if you have a resonance tube, the procedure is very similar. Sound is a wave. As your textbook discusses, reflecting waves interfere. If they interfere constructively, they get louder. An acoustic wave will constructively interfere with a closed air column at specific fractions of its wavelength, namely at 1/4, 3/4, and 5/4, etc. of its wavelength. When the air column’s length equals these fractions of the sound’s wavelength, the sound produced by a tuning fork held above such an air column will become louder.   Equipment Tuning forks Meterstick (metric ruler) Tall graduated cylinder PVC (or other pipe) with an inner diameter of at least 3 cm (if you are using a cylinder) and 50 cm or longer. The outside diameter of the pipe needs to be narrower than the inside diameter of the graduated cylinder. Optional: A resonance tube may be used in place of the previous 2 items.   Safety The vibrations of tuning forks can damage or shatter plastic and glass tubes. Do not touch the tube or the graduated cylinder with the vibrating turning fork!  General Lab Safety: Observe all procedures detailed by your instructor. Keep a clean and orderly work space. If you break or spill something, notify your instructor immediately. If someone needs first aid, notify your instructor immediately. When you have completed an experiment, always dispose of, recycle, or store equipment and supplies in their proper location. If in doubt: Ask!   Demonstration 1: Estimate the Wavelength Ask the Students About what height should a closed air column be (i.e., the length of the PVC tube above the water) for resonance at the first harmonic? Using round numbers and assuming a tuning fork with a frequency of 300 Hz and a speed of sound about 340 meters per second, the wavelength is about 1.1 meters. Dividing by 4 for the first harmonic means an estimate of 25 to 30 centimeters.   Demonstration 2: Harmonics Ask the Students What will be the ratio of the lengths of the air columns for the first three acoustic resonances? They occur at 1/4, 3/4, and 5/4 the wavelength. The second acoustic resonance will be at three times the length of the first and the third will be at five times the first. Multiply the original estimate of the first harmonic by 3 and 5 to calculate the approximate second set of lengths.   Demonstration 3: Calculate the Speed of Sound Ask the Students How might we calculate the speed of sound given our ability to calculate the wavelength and the known frequency of the tuning fork? (Answer: Multiply the two together (making sure we use meters for length), and we have the speed of sound.)   Demonstration 4: Wavelength and Frequency Ask the Students If we use different frequency tuning forks, what relationship should we expect to see between wavelength and frequency? The two multiplied together equal the speed of sound. Wavelength and frequency have an inverse relationship.   Steps in the Demonstration  Partially fill a graduated cylinder with water. You do not want it to overflow when the pipe is placed in it. Place the tube in the graduated cylinder. Note the height of the air column above the water. Begin with a very short air column (about 10 cm).  Use a tuning fork with a known frequency.  Strike the tuning fork. Place it above the tube so that the tines vibrate parallel to the axis of the tube. Raise the tube until the sound clearly becomes louder. This is the fundamental node, or the first harmonic. At this point, the length of the air column is 1/4 the wavelength. (Note: As calculated above, it should be on the order of 20 to 30 centimeters.)  Measure this length in meters. Keep raising the tube so there is a taller column of air between its top and the water in the cylinder. When the sound again becomes louder, you have found the second harmonic. At this point, the length of the air column is 3/4 the wavelength.  Keep raising the tube so there is a taller column of air between its top and the water in the cylinder. When the sound again becomes louder, you have found the third harmonic. At this point, the length of the air column is 5/4 the wavelength.  Ask the students to fill in the table below. Multiply the length of the air column by the appropriate fraction to calculate the wavelength of the sound wave for different harmonics.  If you have multiple tuning forks, complete the table for 2 or 3 frequencies. For a fixed frequency, all of the wavelength measurements should be the same.

Be sure that nothing is in the way when the projectile is launched. Stroboscopes can be dangerous to look at and can cause injury to people with certain medical conditions.  Question(s) for Students What is the acceleration a when considering the horizontal motion? What about vertical motion?  Steps in the Demonstration  Set up the launcher, meterstick, camera, and stroboscope so as to photograph the flight of the ball against a black background. The plumb line should be in the photo so that the direction of true vertical may be determined. The meterstick should be in the frame of the photo and parallel to the plumb line, so that you can translate the “photographic” coordinates to “real-life” coordinates. Keep the shutter of the camera open for 2-5 seconds for optimal results. Ensure that the exit ramp of the launcher is horizontal. Set the strobe to flash at a rate of 30 flashes/sec. This means that successive images of the ball on your photograph will be separated by 1/30 of a second. With the lights out and the stroboscope flashing, one student pushes the shutter button. Another student releases the ball immediately after the shutter button is pressed. You will see the captured image on the camera display. You should have a photograph with approximately 10 images of the ball, separated in time by 1/30 of a second.   Discussion and Analysis On the computer, open the photo with Paint®, and rotate the photograph using the software until the plumb line is vertical. Find the scale factor of your photo. To do so, place the computer cursor on two points on the meterstick that are visible in the photograph. You can read off the “pixel coordinates” from the computer program. Since you know the “real-life” separation of the two selected points, you now have a scale factor that will allow you to translate pixel coordinates to real-life x-y coordinates. For example, if 0.30 m on the meter stick corresponds to 3000 pixels on the photograph, then your scale factor is 0.30m/3000 pixels = 1E-4 meters/pixel. Enlarge the photo enough so that you can see the white dots corresponding to the images of the ball. Place the cursor over each dot and read the coordinates displayed in the lower right corner of the Paint® window. Record these coordinates as “X(pixels)” and “Y(pixels).” Convert them to real-life coordinates by multiplying by the scale factor you determined earlier. Let t = 0 correspond to the location of the first image of the ball. Make a graph of x versus t and do a straight line fit. Now consider the y-values. Calculate the average velocity in the y direction for each interval of 1/15 sec; for example, for the interval between position 3 and position 5, the average velocity in the y direction is .Do this for each point in your data table. If the acceleration is constant, the average velocity that you calculate in this way is equal to the instantaneous velocity at t4. Calculate the instantaneous y-velocity for each of the times in your experiment (except for the first and the last). Make a plot of vy vs. t and do a straight line fit.

Relate them to waves that they observe in the real world. (A slinky spring can demonstrate both longitudinal and transverse waves. Sound waves are longitudinal. Ocean waves are transverse.)

In other words, if you double the frequency, are you supplying the same amount of power to do this as before, twice as much, or more? In your experiment, you will estimate the results.

The ramp is often tilted, so the ball changes speed as it rolls. Although the rules of the game are straightforward, mastering it requires an understanding of the bedrock concepts of linear motion: displacement, velocity and acceleration.  Step right up to the Skee-Ball arcade in this lab and develop your skill! Along the way you can collaborate with your classmates to try to gain the highest total score.  This lab covers the following concepts: Position Displacement Velocity Acceleration Some linear motion equations   Exercise 1: Intro to Skee-Ball  Our Skee-Ball game is a bit different than the one you may have played at your local fairground or amusement park. It is a game of timing and intellectual skill, not physical coordination. Throughout this lab, you will be able to shoot a ball on a ramp straight toward a series of circular slots, as shown in the picture below.  Exercise 1. Shoot ball with correct speed to drop into 50-point slot at 2.00 seconds. In our game, the slots are initially closed. The ball will roll right over the top of them until a stated time when they will all open, allowing the ball to tumble down into one of them. In the first game, the slots will pop open 2.00 seconds after you shoot the ball. As you can see, the slots have scores of 10, 20, 30 and 50. There is also a scale that tells you the positions of the slots in meters (m). The ball is initially at the zero meter position. If your ball is not positioned over any slot when they open, it will roll into the gutter and you will score negative 10 points. You supply the ball with an initial velocity. There is no friction in the game. However, the ramp might be tilted, which could change the ball's velocity. Each game consists of five shots. A scoreboard tallies your progress and displays the number of shots remaining. Give it a try in the first simulation. When you open it, using the link below, you will see a Skee-Ball ramp. There is nothing to calculate here. Just play the game using trial and error. However, we will ask you a question at the end of this section about what you observed. Your ball is next to a plunger that you use to set the ball's initial firing velocity. Use your mouse to click anywhere on this device and pull it back. The farther you pull, the greater the initial velocity the plunger supplies. The velocity in meters per second (m/s) you choose is displayed next to the plunger. Pressing the button marked FIRE will send your ball along the ramp at the initial velocity you have chosen. You can also pause the simulation with the PAUSE button and start a new game with the NEW GAME button. You can even shoot the Skee-Ball in the other direction, to the left, by dragging the plunger to the other side of the ball so that it points in the other direction. This will cause the ball to start with a negative velocity. The negative sign indicates the direction is toward the left. (This technique is necessary in some later exercises.) Use trial and error as you would in a real arcade Skee-Ball game to get a feel for the course and to try to sink the ball in the 50-point slot. Observe the ball's motion after you fire it. Is it moving at a constant speed? Does it ever change direction? If you are not sure, assign the ball a small initial velocity and observe closely. If the ramp is tilted, the force of gravity will accelerate the ball, changing its speed, after you press FIRE. When you are done playing, return here to answer a follow-up question. Click here to enter the Exercise 1 Simulation  1. After you fired the ball, did the ball's speed or direction change?      Exercise 2: Velocity This exercise features a different ramp than Exercise 1. You can get a good score using trial and error, but physics can help you master this game. Two key physics concepts you will need to apply are velocity and acceleration. In this exercise, we will explain velocity first, and then start to explain acceleration. Velocity states the speed and direction of the ball. The speedometer in a car tells you the car’s speed, but not its velocity, since it does not state direction. Sixty km/hr states a speed; 60 km/hr due east states a velocity. Below is the equation for average velocity. Average velocity is defined as the change in position (Δx) divided by the elapsed time (Δt). In equation form, the average velocity of an object between two position points 1 and 2 is:   x1 = position 1 x2 = position 2 t1 = time at position 1 t2 = time at position 2   The change in position, Δx, is the displacement. Displacement states both distance and direction. If the ball moves from a position of 1.0 meter to 3.0 meters along the x axis, the displacement is 3.0 m − 1.0 m, which equals 2.0 meters. When the ball moves to the left, its displacement is negative, since its final position is less than its initial position. The sign of displacement indicates its direction. The timer in the game tells you how much time has passed since the ball was fired. The elapsed time, Δt, is how much time passes as the ball moves from an initial to final position. If you measure the displacement of the ball as it moves from t = 1.00 s to t = 3.00 s, then the elapsed time is 3.00 s − 1.00 s = 2.00 s. As stated, average velocity is the displacement divided by the elapsed time. Example: Suppose the ball moves from 0.50 m to 2.00 m, during which time the clock ticks from 1.00 s to 3.00 s. The ball’s displacement then is 1.50 m, the elapsed time is 2.00 s, and the average velocity is 1.50 m / 2.00 s = 0.75 meters per second (m/s). In this game, we use positive numbers to indicate the ball is moving to the right, and negative numbers to indicate it is moving to the left. A ball that is moving at 3 m/s is moving at the same speed, but opposite direction, of a ball that is moving at −3 m/s. One is moving to the right, and the other to the left. If a ball moves from the position 3.0 m to 1.0 m in two seconds, its displacement is −2.0 m, and its average velocity is −1.0 m/s. The average velocity has the same direction (and sign) as the displacement. In this simulation you will see a gauge below the plunger that displays the ball’s position as it moves along the ramp. You will also see a timer in the scoreboard that starts when you press FIRE. Using the position meter and the timer, you can determine the ball’s average velocity between any two points. Acceleration is the rate of change of the ball’s velocity. It is the change in velocity divided by the elapsed time. Your first challenge in this exercise is to determine at what rate the ball’s velocity changes as it moves along the ramp. In other words, you determine the ball’s acceleration. The acceleration may be zero, which means the velocity does not change. In a follow-up exercise, you will use your findings to calculate the initial velocity that will sink a ball precisely in the 50-point slot. If the ball is not accelerating (its velocity is constant) then choosing an initial velocity for the ball is simpler. If the ball is accelerating (its velocity is changing) then it is more difficult to determine the correct initial velocity needed to sink the ball in the 50-point slot. By recording data to determine a ball’s velocity twice as it moves, you can determine whether the ball’s velocity is constant or changing. Once you know whether the velocity is constant or changing, we will help you calculate how to sink the ball automatically into the 50-point slot.   In this first part of the exercise, there is no game and the slots do not open. Your task is to record data to determine the velocity of the ball after it is fired. Then, you will use your conclusions to play the game in the second part of this section. Pick an initial velocity, vi, for the ball. Press FIRE to shoot the ball along the ramp. When the ball is part way along the ramp, press the PAUSE button to freeze the action. Using the position gauge and the timer, record readings for the ball’s position and the time. Press PAUSE a second time to restart the action. After the ball travels farther along the ramp, push PAUSE again to record another set of data points for position and time. Record your data in the table below. Then, determine if the ball’s velocity is constant or changing as it rolls along the ramp. Remember to record your data in the table below, and answer the follow-up questions. Click here to enter the Exercise 2A Simulation  2.  Enter your data and calculations in the table below. Include the ball’s initial velocity, readings for position and time at any point 1, readings for position and time at point 2, and a calculation of average velocity between 1 and 2.   Vix1t1x2t2Vavg(Δx/Δt)   m/s  m  s  m  s  m/s    3. Using the data, compare your ball’s initial velocity, vi, with its velocity between the two later points. Does the velocity change or stay the same?     4.  Based on your findings about the ball’s velocity on this specific ramp, explain how to calculate an initial velocity that will put the ball into the 50-point slot if the slot is a known distance away, x, and will open in a known amount of time, t.   Now try your answer to Question 4 in the second part of the exercise. The next simulation features a Skee-Ball ramp identical to the one you just investigated. The slots will open 2.00 seconds after you press FIRE. The 50-point slot is 3.00 meters away from the ball’s initial position. What initial velocity should you enter so the ball is positioned over the 50-point slot 2.00 seconds after you fire it? You can use the definition of average velocity to calculate your answer. Give it a try in the simulation. If you do not make it, try again. You get five shots. The sooner you calculate the answer, the higher your total score.  When you are done, return here to answer a follow-up question. If you need a hint on how to solve this problem, click here The velocity of the ball on this ramp is constant. You do not have to worry about the ball speeding up or slowing down. Note how far the ball has to travel to reach the 50-point slot. You know you want it to be at the 50-point slot at 2.00 seconds. You can use the fact that vavg = Δx/Δt to solve the problem. The distance to the 50-point slot is 3.00 meters. The slots will open in 2.00 seconds. Dividing displacement by elapsed time will give you the answer for the ball’s velocity. .  function togglePopup(e){ if(!$(e.target).hasClass(\"midpopup\")){ $(\".midpopup\").show().css(\"left\", \"50%\").css(\"transform\", \"translateX(-50%)\").css(\"-webkit-transform\", \"translateX(-50%)\").css(\"-moz-transform\", \"translateX(-50%)\"); $(document).on(\"click\", hidePopup); } return false; } function hidePopup(e){ if(!$(e.target).hasClass(\"midpopup\") && !$(e.target).hasClass(\"popupParent\")){ $(\".midpopup\").hide(); $(document).off(\"click\", hidePopup); } } Click here to open the Exercise 2B Simulation  5.What initial velocity causes the ball to move 3.00 meters in 2.00 seconds?     Exercise 3: Acceleration In Exercise 2, you learned how to determine the ball’s average velocity. In that exercise, the velocity did not change as the ball traveled along the ramp. Another way of saying the velocity is constant is to say that the acceleration of the ball is zero. What if the acceleration is not zero? In that case, the velocity changes over time. In this exercise, you will determine the ball’s acceleration and then use your conclusions to master a different Skee-Ball ramp. In this simulation, you will see a gauge that displays the ball’s instantaneous velocity, its velocity at a moment in time. Instantaneous velocity is calculated in the same fashion as average velocity, but using the displacement that occurs during a very, very small interval of elapsed time. Average acceleration is defined as the change in instantaneous velocity (Δv) divided by the elapsed time (Δt). In equation form, the average acceleration of an object between any two position points 1 and 2 is:   In this lab, the acceleration is always constant on any ramp. It can be positive, negative or zero, but it does not change in a given simulation. (Note: Some simulations have multiple ramps, and the acceleration may vary from ramp to ramp.)  The ball’s instantaneous velocity will change if the ball is accelerating. By noting the ball’s instantaneous velocity and the time twice, you can use the above equation to calculate the ball’s acceleration. Once you determine the ball’s acceleration, we will help you calculate how to sink the ball into the 50-point slot. In this exercise, there is no game and the slots will not open. Your task is to record data to determine the acceleration of the ball. Pick an initial velocity, vi, for the ball. Press FIRE to shoot the ball along the ramp. Then press the PAUSE button to freeze the action. Using the velocity gauge and the timer, record readings for the ball’s instantaneous velocity and the time. Press PAUSE a second time to restart the action. After the ball travels a bit farther along the ramp, push PAUSE again to record a second set of data for velocity and time. Repeat this 2 more times.  Click here to enter the Exercise 3 Simulation  6.When you graphed the ball’s velocity on the vertical axis, against time on the horizontal axis, you saw a linear graph. What is the meaning of the slope?     7.Does your graph indicate that the ball is accelerating? How do you know? If it is accelerating, is the acceleration positive or negative?    8.Does a negative acceleration mean the ball is “slowing down”? Consider the complete motion of the ball, as it moves in both directions. Use the distinction between speed and velocity in your answer. Remember: Speed is “how fast” but does not indicate direction. Speed is always positive. Velocity reflects speed and direction, and direction in this lab is indicated with a positive or negative sign. Consider the speed of the ball when it first starts moving, and when it passes the plunger on its return journey. How do these speeds compare? What about the two velocities?     9.Graph the ball’s velocity on the vertical axis, against time on the horizontal axis, at four different times. You should see a linear graph. What is the meaning of the constant slope?

Napoleon and Harry Truman labored in the artillery before going on to lead their countries. Being an officer in the artillery is hard work. Aiming a cannon requires a detailed understanding of projectile motion. In this lab, you will use trigonometry, vectors and fundamental motion equations to aim a cannon. Master these skills and destroy the enemy castle before its cannon destroys yours!  You will learn: The principles of projectile motion How velocity can be analyzed as separate vertical and horizontal components How to determine the range of a projectile   Exercise 1: Tower height Your cannon rests on top of a castle tower, as shown in the picture below.  Exercise 1. Use the cannonball to determine the height of the tower. You would like to know the height of your tower. Your challenge is to use the cannonball and a stopwatch to determine the tower’s height. You can drop the cannonball straight down from the top of the tower. Using a stopwatch, can you think of a brief experiment to determine the height of the tower?  vf = vi + at Δy = vit + ½ at2 vf2 = vi2 + 2aΔy Δy = ½ (vi + vf)t   a = −9.80 m/s2 Δy = vertical displacement vi = initial velocity vf = final velocity t = elapsed time You may need to use one of the equations above, which describe one-dimensional motion with constant acceleration. In applying these equations to this exercise, a is the rate of acceleration due to gravity. It is the constant rate at which objects accelerate near the Earth’s surface. Because the motion is in the vertical direction, we use Δy to represent displacement.  The acceleration a is given as a negative number because we use the convention that downward displacement is negative and upward displacement is positive.  Throughout this lab, the effect of air resistance is ignored.   1.In a sentence or two, describe your proposed experiment for determining the height of the tower.   Try your experiment in the simulation. Once you open the simulation, you can start the action by pressing FIRE. The cannonball will drop straight down. When you press FIRE, the stopwatch will start automatically. The stopwatch will stop automatically when the cannonball hits the ground. Note how long it takes for the cannonball to hit the ground. The simulation also contains gauges that show the cannonball’s velocity and acceleration at every instant. These gauges will be used more in later exercises, and we will explain them in more depth then. For ease in taking data, these gauges also stop automatically when the cannonball hits the ground. You can also pause the simulation at any time by pressing PAUSE.  When you are done, close the simulation and return here to record your answers. Click here to open the Exercise 1 Simulation  2.How long does it take for the cannonball to reach the ground?    3.The acceleration due to gravity is −9.80 m/s2.   What is the height of the tower, in meters?      Exercise 2: Firing a cannon horizontally You can analyze the velocity of the cannonball you dropped in Exercise 1 in terms of its horizontal and vertical components.  The cannon gave the cannonball zero horizontal velocity, which is why the cannonball dropped straight down. The cannonball also had zero initial vertical velocity, but the magnitude of the vertical velocity increased as the ball fell. The cannonball’s acceleration had horizontal and vertical components, too. It had zero horizontal acceleration (which, combined with zero horizontal velocity, explains why the cannon is not yet particularly useful, except for “welcoming” uninvited guests at the front door).  The cannonball did have a vertical acceleration: It accelerated in the negative direction, toward the ground, at a = −9.80 m/s2. The cannonball’s vertical acceleration was constant.  The acceleration and velocity gauges in this lab are divided into vertical and horizontal components to help demonstrate these points. You can observe the vertical and horizontal velocity components as they change, or stay constant, over time.  Now you get to fire a more useful cannon − one that supplies an initial horizontal velocity to the cannonball. Your goal is to hit the haystack at the 50-meter mark, as shown in the picture below.   Exercise 2. Choose the firing velocity to hit the haystack. Firing horizontally means that you set the cannon’s initial horizontal velocity. The cannonball will have zero vertical velocity when it leaves the mouth of the cannon.  Try to hit the haystack. In addition to adjusting the velocity, take note of how long it takes for each cannon shot to hit the ground. Be prepared to answer the two questions below (you may want to look at them before you open the simulation).  You set the horizontal firing velocity of the cannon by dragging the arrow (the vector) that emanates from the cannon’s mouth. You can fine-tune the firing velocity by clicking on the up and down buttons in the control panel.  As before, press the FIRE button to shoot the cannon. You can shoot as many times as you like. Try a range of firing velocities, and for each shot note how long it takes for the ball to hit the ground. Also keep an eye on the vertical velocity and acceleration of your cannon shots. Do they change based on the horizontal velocity?  When you are done, return here to answer the questions below. Click here to enter the Exercise 2 Simulation  4.Does the horizontal firing velocity of the cannon affect how long it takes for each cannon shot to hit the ground? Explain your finding, referring to the component nature of velocity and acceleration.      5.Does the horizontal velocity affect the vertical velocity of the cannonball? The vertical acceleration of the cannonball? Explain.      Exercise 3: Blast away! Test your physics skills by firing against an opponent (such as a classmate), or by taking on the computer. In this section, you must use your physics knowledge to calculate how to hit the opposing targets. As in Exercise 2, your cannon fires horizontally and you control only that velocity component. Your challenge is to calculate which firing velocity will hit the opponents’ targets before the opposing player, or the computer, destroys yours.    Exercise 3. Hit the opposing flag and drop a shot through the castle door. When calculating how to hit a target, it is helpful to think about what information you have at your disposal:  By looking at the distance scale, you know exactly where the targets lie along the x axis from the mouth of your cannon atop the tower. In the diagram above, the blue cannon on the left is trying to hit the red flag located 45 m away. The location of the flag will change when you restart the game. The other goal is to fire a cannonball through the door opening by aiming at the point 105 meters away.   You know how much time it will take any cannonball to hit the ground (by observation from Exercises 1 and 2). The two towers are the same height.   Your challenge is to fire the cannonball with a velocity that will cause it to fly the horizontal displacement to a target in the time that it also drops vertically to the ground.  You know how long it will take the cannonball to reach the ground, and how far away the targets are in the horizontal dimension. If you know displacement and time, can you determine velocity? The answer is yes!  Test yourself in the simulation. You rule the blue-flagged castle and control the cannon on top of it. You can set the horizontal velocity of the cannonball by dragging the head of the vector arrow emanating from the cannon’s mouth, or by clicking the up and down buttons in the control panel.  Either the computer or a classmate will run the cannon on top of the red-flagged castle. Whoever hits all the opposing targets first wins the game. The computer hits a target about two out of three times it fires.  Each side is trying to hit two targets. The positions of these targets on the horizontal axis are marked by the triangle locaters that appear beneath the number line.  If you guess − if you do not use your physics knowledge − you may lose. When you open the simulation, choose either PLAY COMPUTER or PLAY CLASSMATE. You may play as many times as you wish by pressing PLAY AGAIN. If you want to start over, press RESET.  Click here to enter the Exercise 3 Simulation   Exercise 4: Fire straight up  In this exercise, you are starting your next stage of artillery training: shooting with a vertical velocity component. Your castle-top cannon has run out of cannonballs, and a battering ram is advancing to destroy your castle!  Fortunately, you have another cannon on the ground, pointed straight up. If you can fire cannonballs to the top of the tower so that they arrive there with zero velocity, the gunner at the top can catch them and use them to fend off the advancing battering ram.     Exercise 4. Shoot the cannonball so it reaches the tower top with zero velocity.  vf = vi + at Δy = vit + ½ at2 vf2 = vi2 + 2aΔy Δy = ½ (vi + vf)t   a = −9.80 m/s2 Δy = vertical displacement vi = initial velocity vf = final velocity t = elapsed time You determined the tower height in Exercise 1. You can shoot with any vertical velocity you want. The mouth of the cannon is at ground level. What initial velocity must you choose so that the ball arrives at the top of the castle with zero velocity? Again, you may need one or more of the equations on the right. These equations describe one-dimensional motion with constant acceleration.  6.Make a calculation in advance: What initial vertical velocity will propel the cannonball upward so that it arrives with zero velocity at the top of the castle?    Now test your answer in the simulation. You control only the vertical velocity of the cannon. Your challenge is to propel the cannonball so that it reaches the peak of its flight at the same height as the top of the tower. At its peak, the cannonball’s velocity must equal zero for your comrade to be able to catch the cannonball.  Enter an initial vertical velocity, in m/s, by dragging the head of the vector arrow or clicking the up and down buttons in the control panel. Press FIRE to try your shot.  Each time you shoot, the battering ram gets closer to your castle! After you have succeeded, press RESET. Now fire the cannonball at a velocity other than the correct answer, like 20.0 m/s. Record how long it takes for the cannonball to reach the peak of its motion and how long it takes to make the other half of the journey (back to the cannon mouth). It may prove effective to push PAUSE when the velocity equals 0.0 m/s in order to record the time at the peak. If you cannot pause the simulation exactly at a peak, consider recording a few data points and calculating an average percentage for the time spent traveling up, versus time spent traveling down. Even though this is a computerized lab, techniques used in traditional labs apply here. Also record the cannonball’s velocity at the end of its journey (the simulation pauses when the cannonball returns to the cannon).  When you are done, return here to answer a follow-up question. Click here to enter the Exercise 4 Simulation  7.When you fire the cannonball so your colleague does not catch it, what percentage of the time does the cannonball spend going up versus down? What is the relationship of the initial and final velocities of the cannonball?      Exercise 5: The symmetry of a projectile  Up until now, you have fired projectiles with the following characteristics:  Zero initial horizontal velocity and zero initial vertical velocity (Exercise 1).  Positive initial horizontal velocity and zero initial vertical velocity (Exercises 2 and 3).   Zero horizontal velocity and positive initial vertical velocity (Exercise 4).  In this exercise, you get to fire a more flexible cannon − one that supplies the cannonball with initial horizontal and vertical velocity components. You will see a parabolic arc traced out by the cannonball as it flies through the air.   Exercise 5. Use the cannon to explore projectile motion. You control the cannonball's initial horizontal and vertical velocities separately. As before, you also have the velocity and acceleration gauges, a stopwatch, and the PAUSE button (which makes collecting data convenient).  We have placed the cannon at a location such that the cannonball will leave the barrel at ground level. Assume the cannonball begins its trajectory at the 0 point on the x axis. When you swivel the cannon’s barrel there will be slight changes in launch location, but they will not significantly affect the range or flight-time of your cannonball. Enter a value for horizontal velocity and a value for vertical velocity, press FIRE, and observe what happens. Try several velocities to see what happens to the ball throughout its arcing flight across the field. The goal of this exercise is to take some data and analyze the flight of a projectile.  Answer the following questions based on your knowledge of physics. Use the simulation either to confirm your answers when you are done, or to obtain some help.   8.For any projectile that launches and lands at the same height, what percentage of the total flight time passes on the way up and what percentage passes on the way down? Use the PAUSE button and the stopwatch to find out. Explain your answer. (This question and the one that follows resemble those in the prior exercise; the conclusions you reach here are important so we stress this point with a little repetition.)    9.For a given firing of the cannon, how does the initial vertical velocity of the cannonball compare to the vertical velocity immediately before the cannonball hits the ground?     10.For a given firing of the cannon, how does the initial horizontal velocity of the cannonball compare to the horizontal velocity immediately before the cannonball hits the ground?   As before, you can select a firing velocity by dragging the head of the vector arrow that emanates from the cannon’s mouth. In the control panel for this simulation, you will see two firing velocity controls, one for the horizontal component of the cannonball's velocity and the other for the vertical component. Both are in m/s.  As before, you also have a stopwatch and the usual gauges and buttons. Choose a vertical and horizontal velocity and fire the cannonball. The gauges display the final values for velocity and acceleration when the cannonball hits the ground.  To answer the question about the percentage of time spent moving up as opposed to down, use the PAUSE button to freeze the cannonball at various points. You will know the cannonball has reached its peak when its vertical velocity equals 0 m/s; it may be more effective to note the cannonball has reached the peak of its motion by looking at this gauge as opposed to the cannonball itself.   Try several combinations of horizontal and vertical velocities. Then return here and answer the above questions. Click here to enter the Exercise 5 Simulation   Exercise 6: Artillery fire!  It is time to put what you have learned about projectile motion to the test. In this exercise, you will again pit your skills against the computer or a classmate, using your knowledge of projectile motion to calculate how to hit the opposing targets on the first try.    Exercise 6. Choose horizontal and vertical velocity components to hit the targets. The cannonballs exit the cannons at ground level. To strike the enemy targets, you must set the initial horizontal and vertical velocity components for your cannonball.  Think again about what determines the arc of your cannonball, and whether it will hit the target. The vertical velocity component determines how long the cannonball remains in the air (from Exercise 4).  The horizontal velocity component determines the cannonball’s range (from Exercises 2 and 3). You can calculate the combination of vertical and horizontal velocities needed to hit any target. Note: The cannon has a minimum vertical velocity of 35 m/s.  If you have trouble hitting these targets, here is a hint. Pick a reasonable value for the vertical component of velocity (again, the minimum is 35 m/s). You can calculate how long the cannonball will be in the air, and then use that time to determine the required horizontal velocity. There are two ways you can determine this flight time; either by considering the relationship between the initial and final velocities of the cannonball, or by considering the vertical velocity at the peak of the cannonball’s motion, and what percentage of the flight time it spends reaching the peak. Applying either of these concepts, and motion equations that have been shown to you in this lab, you can calculate the flight time.   In this simulation, you again rule the blue-flagged castle and control the cannon on the ground in front of it. You choose a combination of horizontal and vertical velocity components for this cannon. Drag the head of the vector arrow emanating from the cannon around until the values you want appear in the control panel. You can also adjust these values using the buttons in the control panel.  Either the computer or a classmate will control the cannon in front of the red-flagged castle. Whoever hits all the opposing targets first wins the game. If you play the computer, you play against a formidable, but not perfect, competitor.  Each side is trying to hit two targets. One is the base of the opposing flag. The other challenge is to fire the ball through the opening in the door to the opposing castle. The horizontal range required to hit these targets is marked with the triangle locaters beneath them.  When you open the simulation, choose either PLAY COMPUTER or PLAY CLASSMATE. You may play as many times as you wish by pressing PLAY AGAIN. If you want to start over, press RESET.  Click here to enter the Exercise 6 Simulation   Exercise 7: Use trigonometry to destroy the castle! In the earlier exercises, you separately specified two parameters: the horizontal and vertical components of the cannonball’s velocity. It is more common for a cannon to fire a cannonball at a fixed speed, and the artillery officer controls the angle at which it is fired.  Using trigonometry, we can determine the velocity components from the firing speed (the magnitude of the velocity vector) and the angle at which the cannon is fired.  In the picture below, note that the cannons again feature vector arrows that can be used to set the initial velocity. As you rotate the vector, a display reads out the angle above the horizontal. By lengthening or shortening the aiming vector, you can change the firing speed.    Exercise 7. Select a firing angle to hit the opposing targets. Your challenge in this exercise is to enter a speed and firing angle to hit the opposing targets before your opponent hits all of yours.  This is similar to Exercise 6, except now your answers must be expressed in terms of firing speed and angle, rather than velocity components. You can convert between velocity components and speed and angle using the following equations:  vy = v sinθ vx = v cosθ v = firing speed θ = firing angle vx and vx = velocity components  The cannon in this simulation can rotate between 45 degrees and 90 degrees (for the cannon on the left), or 135 degrees to 90 degrees (for the cannon on the right).  This time, each player has a battering ram. Every time a shot misses, the battering rams advance on the opposing castle. This means the battering rams are moving targets; they adjust their position after each miss. If you do not hit your opponent’s battering ram before it reaches your castle − look out!  You rule the blue castle and control the cannon on the ground in front of it. Click on the head of the vector arrow and swivel it around until the value for the angle you want appears in the control panel. Shorten or lengthen the vector to change the firing speed.  Either the computer or a classmate will run the cannon for the red castle. Whoever hits all the opposing targets first wins the game.  Each side is trying to hit two targets: 1) an opening of the front door of the opposing castle, and 2) a battering ram team that advances on its mission of smashing your castle.  Record your answers. Note the target, where it was located, and the firing angle used for your cannon to hit the targets. Record those values in the table below.  When you open the simulation, choose either PLAY COMPUTER or PLAY CLASSMATE. You may play as many times as you wish by pressing PLAY AGAIN. If you get stuck, press RESET.  Click here to enter the Exercise 7 Simulation  11.Record the horizontal distance to each target and the firing angle you used to hit the targets in the box below.   Distance from cannon Firing speed Firing angle  Castle door  m  m/s  °  Battering ram  m  m/s  °      Exercise 8 (optional): Establishing a range equation Determining the correct firing speed and angle to hit a target requires a series of calculations. Is there a general approach (equation) for the case when the projectile begins and ends at the same height?  It would help if you had an equation in which the cannon's range − how far the cannonball travels in the horizontal direction − is calculated from the initial firing speed and the cannon angle. If you knew the distance to the target, you could choose a firing angle and solve for the speed (or vice-versa), then blast away!  But what is the equation? In this exercise, your challenge is to establish a range equation for your cannon. You can fire the cannonball at the small lake 225 meters away.    Exercise 8. Use the cannon to validate a range equation. Here are some hints on how to proceed:  Your goal is to write an equation so that the range, or horizontal distance, is dependent on initial speed and cannon angle. There can be other factors in the equation, but they must not vary with the shot (for instance, mass or a). The equation will be of a form so that range (Δx) is set equal to an expression in which the unknown variables are firing speed and aiming angle.   Remember that range is calculated by knowing the horizontal component of the velocity and the time the cannonball stays in the air.   You do not want time as a variable in this equation. You need to find a way to eliminate the time variable. (Extra hint: What determines the time the cannonball stays in the air? Consider writing a second equation and solving that equation for time. Remember that you do know the acceleration of the cannonball in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions.)   Some of the standard motion equations might help!   You can use the cannon simulation to take data, and to experiment with the relationship between firing speed, cannon angle and range.  As before, you can change the firing speed and angle by clicking on the vector arrow emanating from the cannon and swiveling it around until the desired speed and angle appear in the window.  You also have a stopwatch, gauges and the usual buttons − FIRE, PAUSE and RESET. If you succeed in writing an equation, make sure you use the simulation to test it. Enter some values in your equation and then see if the cannon in the simulation reproduces those results.   If you cannot succeed in deriving this equation during the lab, you might ask your teacher or professor whether you can make it a homework assignment to turn in later. If so, fire the cannon a few times, and record the angle, speed and range. Use this data to confirm your equation.   When you are done, return here to answer some follow-up questions. Click here to enter the Exercise 8 Simulation (optional)  12.Write an equation you could use to calculate projectile range (horizontal distance) for any initial velocity and cannon angle. Since you are using a computer to write an equation, you may need to use words to describe the equation (for example, the range equals the square root of the cosine of the firing angle).     13.Even if you do not succeed in determining the equation, try this additional exercise. Pick a speed and an angle (other than 45°) and determine the range. With the speed constant, can you determine another angle which will result at the same range? Try experimenting until you can do so. How are these two angles related? If you succeeded in deriving the equation, can you briefly explain how the equation confirms that two angles will yield a given range for a particular speed?

Done correctly, juggling is a beautiful demonstration of projectile motion. This lab covers the physics of juggling. By the end, you will be skilled enough to juggle five chainsaws!  This lab covers the following topics: horizontal and vertical components of velocity projectile motion calculating range and height for projectiles how to juggle five (virtual) chainsaws and amaze your friends   Exercise 1: Juggling one ball Throwing a single ball into the air and catching it may not seem like juggling. But the simple catch and throw is the basis for all juggling. Jugglers must be able to throw a ball to a consistent height and judge precisely when and where it will land. A common way to learn to juggle is to start with one ball, throwing it so that it stays in the air for a consistent amount of time.   Exercise 1. Pick an initial vertical velocity to keep the ball in the air for 1.4 seconds. In the first exercise, your challenge is to determine the initial vertical velocity so that the ball’s time of flight, or hang time, is 1.4 seconds. This time is how long it takes the ball to rise to its peak and fall back to its initial height, where the juggler will catch it. When a ball is thrown upward, the force of gravity causes it to accelerate at a constant rate, slowing the ball as it rises and then speeding it up as it falls. While the ball is in the air, its acceleration is −9.80 m/s2. The magnitude of this acceleration is represented by g; the sign is negative because the acceleration is downward. A ball thrown upward has positive “y“, or vertical, velocity. The ball slows until its velocity is zero at the peak of its motion. After that, the ball continues to accelerate at −9.80 m/s2, which means it then has negative y velocity and is moving downward.  vf = vi + at Δy = vit + ½ at2 vf2 = vi2 + 2aΔy Δy = ½ (vi + vf)t   a = −9.80 m/s2 Δy = vertical displacement vi = initial velocity vf = final velocity t = elapsed time The equations shown in the box above describe this linear freefall motion. Throughout the lab, you may make use of some or all of these motion equations. Because in this lab you will use these equations to determine motion in the vertical direction, we specify the displacement as Δy. The same equations also can be used to describe motion in the horizontal direction. In that case, Δx is substituted for Δy. As stated, the variable a in this lab is the acceleration due to gravity, −9.80 m/s2.  Later, we will introduce the horizontal velocity with which the juggler throws the ball from one hand to the other. For now, the juggler throws a single ball up and back down to the same hand. The effect of air resistance is ignored during this entire lab.  1.Using one or more of the motion equations shown in the box above, calculate the initial vertical velocity needed to throw a ball into the air for a total flight time of 1.4 seconds, assuming the acceleration due to gravity is −9.80 m/s2. Your answer should be accurate to the nearest 0.1 m/s.    Test your answer in the juggling simulation. When you open the simulation, you will see a control panel at the bottom. It contains one input gauge, marked \"Initial y velocity.” This controls the vertical (y) component of the ball's velocity. You should specify a value in the “Initial y velocity” gauge, in meters per second, m/s. (The ball’s x velocity is fixed at 0 m/s, although you will be able to adjust it later in this lab.) Again, your goal is to throw the ball straight up in the air so that its total time of flight − up and then down − is as close as possible to 1.4 seconds. Once you have specified a value for the y velocity, press GO. Is the total flight time 1.4 seconds? The stop watch provided in the control panel runs automatically and will enable you to see if your initial velocity is correct. Don’t worry if you do not get it right the first time. As with real juggling, you can try again. Hit RESET, type in a new value, and press GO. You can try it as many times as you like. When you are done, return here to answer some follow-up questions. Click here to open the Exercise 1 Simulation  2. Does the ball take the same amount of time to rise to its peak as it does to fall from the peak back down? (Use the simulation to find the answer to this question. The PAUSE button will help you.)     3. To get the ball to go straight up and come back down to the same hand, the value for the x velocity must be zero. Why?      Exercise 2: Two balls with one hand Now we add a second ball. Because a hand cannot catch and throw at the same instant, you must stagger the throws and catches. When juggling two balls with one hand, you should throw the second ball approximately when the first ball is at the peak of its flight. Later, when you juggle three balls, we will help you determine the correct timing of the throws. Your challenge in this exercise is to juggle two balls with one hand. As in Exercise 1, you will assign an upward velocity to the balls so each hangs in the air for 1.4 seconds. In this exercise you must also specify a time interval between throws, in seconds. This time is equal to the time it takes for one ball to rise from the juggler’s hand to the peak of its flight.  Firing horizontally means that you set the cannon’s initial horizontal velocity. The cannonball will have zero vertical velocity when it leaves the mouth of the cannon.   4. You want to throw a ball upward so that its hang time − the time it takes to go up and then back down − is 1.4 seconds. How long will it take, in seconds, for the ball to reach its peak?    The time it takes a ball to rise to its peak is the time you should specify in the “Time interval” gauge in the control panel. If you specify the correct time, the juggler will throw the second ball precisely when the first ball is at the peak. You can also check your answer using the stopwatch in the control panel. Changing the interval between tosses affects the spacing between the balls. You can successfully keep the balls in the air with a wide range of interval values, but the juggling will look most polished when you have the right interval.   In the control panel gauge marked \"Initial y velocity,\" specify a value for the vertical component of the ball's velocity that will keep it in the air for a total of 1.4 seconds. This is the same as the value that you used in Exercise 1. In the gauge marked \"Time interval,\" specify a time, in seconds, for a ball with a total hang time of 1.4 seconds to reach its peak. After you press GO, the computer will throw the first ball according to your velocity, then automatically throw the second ball with the same velocity after waiting the period of time you specify. This cycle will repeat until you close the simulation or the juggler drops a ball. It may appear that the balls are overlapping in flight, and perhaps should collide. Assume that when the balls appear to be passing through one another, what is really happening is that one is passing in front of the other. You can try again by hitting RESET and specifying new values in the control panel. When you are done, return here to answer a follow-up question. Click here to open the Exercise 2 Simulation  5. You may have noticed that a ball with a total hang time of 1.4 seconds always rises to the same height above the juggler’s hands. What is that height? (You may need to use one or more of the motion equations in the table in Exercise 1 to answer this question.) You can also check your calculated answer using the simulation.     Exercise 3: Two balls with two hands You are almost a virtual juggler. Now you just have to learn to throw from one hand to the other. In this exercise, you will specify the same two values as in Exercise 2: the vertical, or y, component of velocity and the time interval between throws. You will also determine how to throw the balls horizontally from one hand to the other.   Exercise 3. Give each ball a hang time of 1.4 seconds and hit the other hand 0.70 m away. How can you do this? You know the vertical velocity needed to give each ball a total hang time of 1.4 seconds. The distance between the juggler's hands is 0.70 meters. Knowing this distance, and knowing the time it takes for a ball to travel through its entire arc of motion, you can calculate the x, or horizontal, component of velocity needed to throw the ball from one hand to the other. Unlike the vertical component of velocity, the horizontal component will be constant.   6. Using the above information, calculate the horizontal velocity needed to precisely toss each ball from the juggler's right hand to his left hand (given that the hang time of each ball is 1.4 seconds).     Test your answer. Specify three values in the control panel: an initial y velocity, an initial x velocity, and the time interval between throws. You should use the same time interval here that you calculated in Exercise 2 (the time it takes for a ball to rise to the peak of its arc). Using the values you give, the computer will automatically program the second hand to throw the balls back to the beginning hand. You only have to get it right going from the juggler's right hand to his left hand (from your left to your right). Again, try as many times as you like to get it right. You can press RESET at any time and specify new values. When you are done, return here to answer some follow-up questions. Click here to open the Exercise 3 Simulation  7. Was your predicted value for the initial x velocity correct? If not, try again and write the correct velocity in the box below.    8. Does the fact that a ball has a horizontal velocity affect the initial y velocity or how long the ball is in the air? Use the gauges in the simulation to inform your answer.      Exercise 4: The amazing juggler You are ready to juggle! Juggling three balls is not much different than juggling two. Again, you will specify the initial y velocity, the initial x velocity, and the time delay between throws. As before, you want to throw each ball into the air for 1.4 seconds, during which time each ball will move through a horizontal displacement of 0.70 meters. In juggling three or more objects, there is a formula for calculating the correct time interval between throws so that your virtual juggling looks as polished as the real thing. First, determine the time it takes for a single ball to leave one hand, rise and fall to the other hand, and then rise and fall back to the starting hand (in other words, double the hang time). Second, divide this round trip time by the number of objects being juggled. The result is the desired time interval between throws. Example: Suppose you want to juggle three balls so that each one has a hang time of 2.0 seconds. Each ball would take 4.0 seconds to complete a round trip, a total of 2.0 seconds to go up from the first hand and down to the second, then another 2.0 seconds to make the return trip. The time delay between throws then would be 4.0 seconds divided by 3, which is 1 1/3 seconds. In other words, when juggling three balls, the second ball should be thrown a little after the first ball has passed the peak of its arc. (You will use this formula again later when attempting to juggle five chainsaws!)  Give juggling three balls a try. Each ball should have a hang time of 1.4 seconds. Specify an initial y velocity and an initial x velocity so that each ball travels 0.70 m horizontally during its flight time. Also specify a time interval between throws using the input gauges in the control panel. Then press GO and amaze your friends! The computer will automatically program the second hand, using your specified values, to throw the balls back to the beginning hand. If you get the time interval correct, a ball will be released just when the prior ball is starting to fall toward the other hand. Your juggling will look as smooth and polished as a professional’s. Once you have successfully juggled three balls, try juggling higher or lower by varying the initial y velocity. Here's something to think about: If you increase the initial y velocity, will the initial x velocity required for the juggler to catch the balls with the other hand increase, decrease or stay the same? Why? When you are done, return here to go on to the next exercise. Click here to open the Exercise 4 Simulation  9. If you increase the initial y velocity of the balls (i.e. throw them higher), does the initial x velocity required for the juggler to catch the balls with the other hand increase, decrease or stay the same? Why?      Exercise 5: Juggling to a specific height Now that you know how to juggle you can do all sorts of tricks to wow the crowd. How about juggling the balls through a hoop at a set height above the juggler’s hands? In this exercise, your juggler should throw the balls through the hoop, the center of which is 6.0 meters above his hands. His hands are 1.1 meters apart, as shown in the illustration below.    Exercise 5. Juggle through the center of the hoop 6.0 meters up. Here, the challenge is to juggle consistently to a certain height. Notice that we did not mention the hang time. Starting with the vertical and horizontal displacement, you must determine the initial y velocity, hang time and initial x velocity. Then, you must also determine the time interval between throws, using the technique outlined in the previous exercise.   10. What initial y velocity is needed to throw a ball 6.0 meters vertically into the air, assuming that the acceleration due to gravity is −9.80 m/s2?     11. What is the total hang time − the time going up plus the time falling back down − of a ball thrown to a height of 6.0 meters?    12. What initial x velocity will move the ball through a horizontal displacement of 1.1 m in the time it takes the ball to rise to 6.0 meters and fall back down again?     Use the simulation to test your answers. The usual input gauges are in the control panel, for initial y velocity, initial x velocity, and the time interval between throws. Determine the time interval between throws by doubling the hang time and dividing it by three (the number of balls). You should have calculated the hang time in Question #11 above. Specify your values by clicking the up/down buttons that control the three input gauges in the control panel. Press GO to see if the juggler successfully juggles three balls through the hoop. You can try as many times as you like using the RESET button. Do not get discouraged. If you calculate incorrectly, use the simulation to figure out where you may have gone wrong. You can use the stopwatch in the simulation to check hang times. Redo your calculations as needed and try again. When you are done with the simulation, return here to continue on to the next exercise. Click here to open the Exercise 5 Simulation  7.When you fire the cannonball so your colleague does not catch it, what percentage of the time does the cannonball spend going up versus down? What is the relationship of the initial and final velocities of the cannonball?

But how close to the edge are you willing to go? Pushing it to the limit is the key to beating your rival, the computer car. But accelerate a little too much and you will spin off the track and crash. The key to your success: Understanding the relationship between speed, velocity and acceleration as you go around turns on a race track.   This lab covers the following topics:  The difference between speed, velocity and acceleration How you can accelerate without changing speed Centripetal acceleration The effect of turn radius on centripetal acceleration The relationship between your speed on a turn and centripetal acceleration   Exercise 1: Speed, velocity and acceleration Race car drivers live in a world of speed, velocity and acceleration. What is the difference among the three? Let's review. Before you drive the perilous turns of a speedway, you first need to get your driver's license on a straightaway.    Exercise 1. Win the drag race against the computer. Consider the track above, a snapshot of the simulation you are about to enter. You drive the red car. Your challenge: beat the computer car − the blue car − in a drag race. The track is divided into two segments. In the first segment, your car’s speed increases. Here, your car will go from rest (0 m/s) to the speed you select for it, up to a maximum of 30 m/s. In the second segment, the car will maintain the selected speed until the finish line, at which point the simulation will pause. No calculations are required in this simulation. You will have to try setting some speeds and see what happens. The primary purpose of this exercise is to familiarize you with the simulation controls and to review the concepts of speed, velocity and acceleration. When you enter the simulation, notice the gauges for your car (the red car) on the control panel:   On the left is a speed gauge. It resembles a standard car speedometer, although the readout is in meters per second. 10 m/s equals 36 km/hr, which is about 22 mph.  The next gauge shows acceleration. It indicates the magnitude of your car's acceleration, in m/s2.  To the right of that is a horizontally-shaped gauge for x velocity. It shows the component of your car's velocity along the x axis, that is, in the horizontal direction on your screen.  The final, verticall y-shaped gauge is for y velocity. It shows the component of the car’s velocity along the y axis, which is the vertical direction on your screen.   Observe the gauge readings as you race. Use what you observe to answer the questions below.   Open the simulation and enter a value for speed in the entry box in the control panel. Press GO to start the race. During the race, observe the gauges described above. Note the values for speed, x and y velocity and acceleration in the first segment of the race, marked “Speed change zone,” as well as the second segment, marked “Constant speed zone.” If you have trouble viewing the gauges, use the PAUSE button to temporarily stop the simulation. Press PAUSE again to restart it. Use the simulation and the gauges to answer the questions below which review some fundamentals of speed, velocity and acceleration. You can run the race as many times as you want by pressing RESET, entering a new value for speed and pressing GO again.  Click here to enter the Exercise 1 Simulation  1. In the first segment of the race track (the Speed change zone), the car speeds up as it travels left to right across the screen. Does the car’s x velocity change? Its y velocity?     2. Acceleration is defined as the change in velocity per unit time. In the first segment of the race track, does the car accelerate?    3. In the second segment of the race track (the Constant speed zone), does the car’s x velocity change? Its y velocity?     4.  In the second segment of the race track, does the car accelerate? In other words, does its velocity change?     Exercise 2: Racing around a curve In Exercise 1, you controlled only the speed of your car. In physics and in car racing, direction matters, too. Most race tracks and roads have curves, and the driver must change the car’s direction to navigate around them. Velocity is a vector, and it reflects both speed and direction. 50 meters per second is speed, while 50 meters per second to the right is velocity. Your car has two gauges that show the x and y components of the velocity. These gauges will help you understand the relationship between speed, velocity and acceleration when your car is traveling around a curve. Consider the next race on the track shown below. This race begins the same as the first, with a straight Speed change zone. But the second segment, the Constant speed zone, has been bent into a curve.    Exercise 2. Race against the computer around a curve. Again, you drive the red car, and again, you set your speed. As before, this will be the speed at which you enter the Constant speed zone. The track is divided into two segments. The Speed change zone is for speeding up: Here, your car will go from rest (0 m/s) to the speed you enter. In the Constant speed zone the car will maintain the speed you entered until the finish line, at which point the simulation will pause. You do not know how fast your car will have to go to beat the blue car. As in Exercise 1, you must try various speeds until you win. This time, if your car’s speed is too high, it will spin off the track on the curve. Your primary goal in this exercise is to observe the gauges in your car and answer questions about speed, velocity and acceleration. Soon, you will use your knowledge of physics to move faster than the computer car without spinning off the track.   Open the simulation and enter a value for speed in the entry box in the control panel. Press GO to start the race. During the race, observe the gauges in the control panel. Note some values for speed, x and y velocity and acceleration, particularly during the curved segment of the race. The simulation also shows you a velocity vector on the red car, indicating the car’s speed and direction of travel. Use the simulation and the gauges to answer the questions below. You can run the race as many times as you want by pressing RESET, entering a new value for speed and pressing GO again. (Because of the turn, the red car starts in front of the blue car so that they travel the same distance to the finish line.) Click here to enter the Exercise 2 Simulation  5. The car moves with a constant speed on the curve. Does the car’s x velocity change on the curve? Its y velocity?     6. Does the car accelerate as it moves around the curve?    7. In Exercise 2, a car traveling at constant speed accelerates. Explain, using the definition of velocity.     Exercise 3: Centripetal acceleration You have seen that a car moving at a constant speed accelerates when it changes direction. When a car travels along a circular path, the acceleration due to its change in direction is called centripetal acceleration. You know how to determine the amount of linear acceleration. It is the change in instantaneous velocity divided by change in time as an object moves in a straight line. It results from a change in the speed, the magnitude of velocity. Centripetal acceleration also is change in velocity divided by change in time but it results from the change in the direction of the velocity, not a change in magnitude.  (Linear and centripetal acceleration can also occur simultaneously on a curve, for instance if the car speeds up or slows down along a curve, but that is a more advanced topic not covered in this lab.) In the diagram shown here, you see the velocity vector vi for a car in a turn at an initial time, and then the velocity vector vf at a later time. Note that the two vectors are the same length, indicating that the magnitude of velocity, or speed, is unchanged. The direction of the velocity vector clearly has changed. Acceleration can be determined by the change in velocity per unit time. The change in velocity, Δv, is determined by subtracting the vi vector from the vf vector. In the lower diagram we graphically show the subtraction that yields the change in the velocity vector, Δv. Note that the change in velocity (acceleration) points inward, toward the center of the circle. The centripetal acceleration vector always points to the center of the circle. What determines the amount of centripetal acceleration? In the next two exercises, you will investigate the two factors that determine the amount of centripetal acceleration. The first exercise explores the relationship between the tightness of a turn (its radius) and a car’s centripetal acceleration on that turn. Later, you will use the equation for centripetal acceleration to calculate how to beat the computer car every time! Consider the next track, in which the cars navigate a course with two turns. The two turns are sections of circles with different radii, as you can see:    Exercise 3. Find the relationship between turn radius and centripetal acceleration. In this race, you pick a speed for the red car, and it will travel at that same speed for the entire race. The computer car also maintains a constant speed for the entire race. The game challenge is to beat the computer car to the finish. If your centripetal acceleration is too great on either curve, you will spin off the track and lose. You are accelerating too much for the frictional force between the tires and the road to keep you on the track. You have to use trial and error to beat the race car. The physics question posed by this simulation is: What is the relationship between the radius of a turn and the car’s centripetal acceleration?   Open the simulation and choose a speed for your red car. The car will travel this speed for the entire race unless it leaves the track. Press GO to start the race. Record a few data points asked for in the table below. Press PAUSE to stop the car in a turn, and press PAUSE again to restart it. You can race as many times as you want by pressing RESET and then GO. You will likely need to try racing at several speeds to determine the winning speed. When you are done, return here to analyze your data and answer a few questions. Click here to enter the Exercise 3 Simulation  11. For any race in which your car completed the course, enter the data points below:  car speedradius turn 1centripetal acceleration turn 1radius turn 2centripetal acceleration turn 2  15.0m 7.5m    12. What is the relationship, if any, between the radius of a turn and the centripetal acceleration of the car? Does centripetal acceleration increase when the radius increases, Does it decrease, or does the centripetal acceleration stay the same?    13.  If you said there was a relationship between turn radius and centripetal acceleration, explain what might cause this relationship, using the definition of acceleration.      Exercise 4: Speed and centripetal acceleration In this exercise, you will investigate the effect of speed on centripetal acceleration by driving at different speeds around the circular course pictured below.    Exercise 4. Find the relationship between speed and centripetal acceleration. There is no race in this exercise − your task is to record and interpret data. Do a lap around the track at three different speeds and note the centripetal acceleration for each speed. Enter these data points in the table below.   Open the simulation and enter a speed in the input box provided in the control panel. Press GO. Record the centripetal acceleration. Select two more speeds and repeat. Make the values vary in a logical sequence − for example, try doubling the speed each time.  Return here to record your data when you are done. Click here to enter the Exercise 4 Simulation  14. Fill in the table below   speed of carcentripetal acceleration  Trial 1 m/s m/s2  Trial 2 m/s m/s2  Trial 3 m/s m/s2    15. Graph the data, centripetal acceleration versus speed. From the graph, can you determine the relationship between the centripetal acceleration of the car and its speed? Does the centripetal acceleration increase when the speed increases, decrease, or does the centripetal acceleration not change at all? If you see a relationship, is it linear, inverse, or does it vary with the square of the speed?      Exercise 5: Grand Prix of physics In the previous two exercises, you explored the relationship between centripetal acceleration and two variables: the radius of a circular curve, r, and the speed with which an object negotiates the curve, v. Your data showed that centripetal acceleration varies inversely with the curve radius. Centripetal acceleration is also proportional to the square of the speed. The equation for centripetal acceleration is provided in the box to the right.  You already intuitively understand these relationships − on skis, in a car, or on a bicycle, you know to slow down when entering a tight curve. You may not have known it at the time, but you were reducing your centripetal acceleration. It is time to put your physics knowledge to the test in a high-speed car race! In the course pictured below, you will use your knowledge of centripetal acceleration to go as fast as possible in the turns without crashing.    Exercise 5. Use your physics knowledge to beat the computer car to the finish.  The radius of each turn is listed on the track. In this race, the maximum centripetal acceleration you can attain before crashing is 3 g's, or 29.4 m/s2. This roughly corresponds to the maximum centripetal acceleration experienced by drivers in the Daytona 500 as they speed around the track’s steeply-banked turns. If you exceed 29.4 m/s2 centripetal acceleration in any turn, your car will spin off the track. The cars have staggered starts to compensate for the different distances they travel due to the curves. Your challenge: Select a speed in the control panel so your acceleration is slightly below 29.4 m/s2. We have programmed the cars so they will speed up and slow down in the straight-aways to attain the turn speeds at the beginning of each turn. Once in a turn, the cars will travel at the speed you set. The computer car is calibrated to run the race at more than 95 percent of the maximum safe speed for each turn. Only a well-programmed car will beat the computer.   Open the simulation. Use the turn radii to calculate the maximum speeds your car can travel in each curve without exceeding a centripetal acceleration of 29.4 m/s2. Enter these speeds in the entry boxes marked Turn 1, Turn 2 and Turn 3. When you think you have programmed your car for top racing performance, press GO to start the race. (Note: your car will not start the race instantaneously with the speed you specify. Instead, like the computer’s car, it will start with zero velocity and accelerate to its specified speed for the first curve over the length of the first straightaway. Both cars will likewise adjust their specified speeds for entering the other two curves while they are on the intervening straightaways.) If you crash, you exceeded the maximum acceleration in one of the turns. If you lose, you were too slow in one or more of the turns. In either case, press RESET to try again. Return here when you are finished to fill in the answers below. Click here to enter the Exercise 5 Simulation  16.  Enter the speed for your car in each turn that enabled you to win the race.   radiusspeed  Turn 1 8.00 m m/s  Turn 2 16.75 m m/s  Turn 3 8.75 m m/s     Exercise 6: Control the car with keys Here you can have some fun and test your basic driving skills. So far, you have been experimenting with uniform circular motion, motion in two dimensions in which the speed and radius are constant. This is a special case of motion that occurs along two or three dimensions. Here, we relax the constraints. You attempt to drive your car along a circular path, but it is unlikely you will achieve perfectly uniform circular motion. You control the horizontal and vertical velocity using the arrow keys on your keyboard. The right arrow increases the horizontal velocity component and the left arrow decreases it. The up arrow key increases the vertical velocity, and yes, the down arrow decreases it. Your mission is to stay on the course and if possible, complete a lap, using these keys.    Exercise 6. Stay on track!  Your car will start moving when you press any of the arrow keys. There is no penalty for driving your car off the track, though striking a wall is not good for your insurance rates. Press RESET to start over. Happy motoring!  Click here to enter the Exercise 6 Simulation   Exercise 7 (optional): Use the force Now you have to use what you know about the force of friction and apply Newton’s second law to win the race. Each turn has a section where the heat of the day has caused the pavement to start to melt, as you can see in the illustration below. The coefficient of friction for your tires on these slick sections is 0.75. Your car has better traction everywhere else. The mass of your car is 1724 kg. The friction supplies the centripetal force, the force that keeps the car moving around a turn instead of flying off the track along a straight line. By multiplying your car’s centripetal acceleration by its mass, you can determine the centripetal force required to keep the car on the track. (You are applying Newton’s second law, multiplying mass by acceleration to determine force.) Since you want to go as fast as possible, determine the maximum frictional force, and from that, determine the maximum speed at which your car can move. Set the speed of your car to that value, or slightly below if necessary, to win the race. You will move at the same speed in this simulation through both turns. You only need to determine the maximum speed for one of the turns, if you pick the right turn.    Exercise 7. Navigate the hazards on the curves.  Calculate your maximum speed and enter it into the simulation. Press GO to see if you both stay on the race track and beat the computer race car. Click here to enter the Exercise 7 Simulation  17.

In this lab, you will apply this principle to fly a helicopter. Flying a helicopter is also an exercise in balancing forces. For example, when a helicopter is hovering motionless in the air, the sum of all the forces acting on the helicopter is zero. The force of gravity pulls down on the helicopter while an equal but opposite force generated by the spinning rotor blades pushes the helicopter up. When the net force acting on a body equals zero, it is in equilibrium. This does not necessarily mean it is stationary − a helicopter flying at a constant velocity is also in equilibrium, since it is not accelerating. Helicopter pilots place their craft in equilibrium both to hover, and to maintain a constant speed and direction. In this lab, you are the pilot of a helicopter. Your mission is to guide the helicopter safely through a series of missions. You will do so by using your knowledge of forces, Newton’s laws and the concept of equilibrium. (In this lab, we consider only translational − linear − motion. We ignore any torques which could cause the helicopter to have rotational acceleration. Torque and rotational motion are outside the scope of the lab.)   Exercise 1: Going airborne In the simulation for this first exercise, you can attempt some of the basic tasks required of a helicopter pilot. To do so, you control the net force upward on the helicopter. When the helicopter is in the air, the net force equals the positive lift force, which points up, plus its negative weight, which points down. (The lift force is caused by the interaction of the spinning blades with the air, and is used to propel the helicopter upward.) Throughout this lab, the upward direction is positive and the downward direction is negative. The net force, like all forces, is measured in newtons (N). When the helicopter is in the air, you can set the net force to positive, negative, or zero values. The net force is negative when the magnitude of the helicopter’s lift force is less than its weight, except for when it is on the ground. When it is on the ground, there cannot be a negative net force because the normal force from the ground opposes the downward force of the helicopter’s weight and does not allow the helicopter to sink below the Earth’s surface.   Exercise 1. Determine the force required to fly the helicopter straight up and hover motionless.  To start, apply a positive net force to cause the helicopter to rise off the ground. Next, attempt to have the helicopter reach a constant vertical velocity. For an optional challenge, have it hover at a constant height of 15 meters, and finally, attempt to land (not crash) the helicopter. Once in the air, you may find that controlling the craft is a little trickier than you anticipated − it may act a little skittish. Welcome to (a) the difficulties of flying a helicopter and (b) Newton’s world. Here are a few hints: Start slowly! Initially, just use small net forces. You can look at the acceleration gauge to see in which direction you are accelerating. Try to keep your acceleration initially between plus or minus 0.25 m/s2.  The simulation starts with the helicopter on the ground and a net force of 0 N. To increase the net force on the helicopter, press the up arrow key (↑) on your keyboard; to decrease it, press the down arrow key (↓). This net force will continue to be applied until you change it. The purpose of this exercise is to give you a little practice flying a helicopter before facing some more challenging missions.  Click here to enter the Exercise 1 Simulation  1. When the helicopter is moving at a constant velocity, is there a net force acting on it?    2. The helicopter first moves up, and then you caused it to hover (or attempted to cause it to hover). Did there have to be a negative net force acting on the craft at some point for this to occur? Why?     Exercise 2: What is the mass of the helicopter?  In later exercises, you will need to know the mass and weight of your helicopter. In this exercise, you want to determine its mass. To do so, you will use Newton’s second law, ∑F = ma. This law states that the sum of the forces on an object, which is the net force, equals the mass times the acceleration. Both force and acceleration are vectors, and the acceleration is in the same direction as the net force. The helicopter has the same controls as before. The acceleration gauge will prove highly useful in this exercise. Apply a net force of 2000 N to the helicopter and observe its acceleration. Using this data, you can apply Newton’s second law and determine the helicopter’s mass.   Exercise 2. Determine helicopter’s mass by setting the net force and observing the acceleration.  This simulation also starts with the helicopter on the ground and a net force of 0 N. To increase the net force on the helicopter, press the up arrow key (↑) on your keyboard; to decrease it, press the down arrow key (↓). This net force will continue to be applied until you change it.  Set the force as requested above and observe the acceleration. Then pick another force, and observe the acceleration for that force. For instance, you might observe the acceleration when the net force is negative.  Click here to enter the Exercise 2 Simulation  Complete the table below   ForceAcceleration  Data point 1 N m/s2  Data point 2 N m/s2    3. Does the acceleration change with the net force? What is the mathematical relationship of acceleration and net force?    4. What is the mass of the helicopter? How did you determine it?     Exercise 3: Net force and acceleration So far, you have been controlling the vertical acceleration of the helicopter by setting the net force on the helicopter. Life is about to get a little more complicated. First, controlling the helicopter now takes a little more intellectual effort. You now set the lift force, and have to use that force to determine the net vertical force acting on the helicopter. As stated earlier, the lift is the upward force caused by the helicopter’s rotors. The weight of the helicopter pulls it down. Since you calculated the mass, you can determine the helicopter’s weight by multiplying its mass by g, 9.80 m/s2.  Figure 1. The vertical forces acting on the helicopter The amount of weight equals mg, and the force is downward. We treat the lift force as positive since it is an upward force and the weight as negative since that force is downward. Figure 1 shows the vertical forces acting on the helicopter. Second, and maybe we should have mentioned this first, your helicopter is plummeting toward the ground and will crash unless you do something about it. Bummer. Your co-pilot has fainted, but his words before passing out were: “If you can cause the helicopter to accelerate at 5.88 m/s2, we’re saved.” You trust him − he is a distinguished scientist, even if he does not react all that well to pressure. If you set that acceleration, the helicopter will land safely. If you err, it will crash into the ground, or fly off into space. To solve the problem, you will have to know the helicopter’s mass. We hope you determined it correctly before, but since it is required to solve the problem, please click here to check your figure. If you made an error, it will cause problems for you in the rest of the lab.  The helicopter starts 39.3 meters above the ground with a velocity of −21.5 m/s. We have paused the motion of the helicopter so you have a chance to set your controls before the helicopter crashes. You set the lift force using the scroll button. When you have set the desired lift force, press GO to test your answer.  Click here to enter the Exercise 3 Simulation  5. What lift force was required to save the day?     Exercise 4: Air resistance  So far, we have ignored air resistance that would impede the helicopter’s progress. In this exercise, air resistance is now a factor in the simulation. The purpose of this exercise is to use your helicopter to determine how the force of air resistance varies with the speed of the helicopter. Does the force of air resistance increase as the helicopter’s speed increases? Does it decrease? Does it stay the same? If it changes, what is the mathematical relationship between the two? To answer these questions, you will fly the helicopter at different horizontal speeds. In the simulation, the helicopter will initially be hovering above the ground. Increase its thrust, and it will accelerate. However, with air resistance now acting on the helicopter, it will reach a particular velocity and stop accelerating. Why does the helicopter cease to accelerate? For a given amount of thrust force, at a particular speed the force of air resistance balances the thrust force. This means there is no net force acting on the helicopter. The speed at which this occurs increases with the thrust force. This speed we will call terminal velocity (in principle, it should probably be called “terminal speed” since we are only considering magnitude, but terminal velocity is the more common term). The terminal velocity is a constant velocity at which the force of air resistance is equal to the force propelling an object. Here, you are experimenting with terminal velocity that occurs along the horizontal axis. Often terminal velocity is demonstrated with objects in free fall. You can use the amount of thrust to measure how air resistance relates to speed. You are asked to graph the magnitude of the air resistance for at least three terminal helicopter speeds, and then interpret the graph to determine how air resistance relates to helicopter speed.  There is no mission in this exercise other than collecting and interpreting data. Fly the helicopter by applying thrust using the left and right arrow keys, and wait until it is moving at a constant horizontal velocity. You can tell whether it is moving at a constant horizontal velocity by looking at the horizontal velocity or acceleration gauge. Note: Have some patience! It may take 10 or 20 seconds before your helicopter reaches a constant velocity. Using the helicopter’s gauges, determine the opposing force of air resistance for this helicopter speed. Remember, you can do this by relying on the fact that if the helicopter is moving at a constant horizontal velocity, then it is in equilibrium along that axis. Once you establish that the helicopter is in equilibrium, the horizontal thrust force of the helicopter is exactly balanced by the force of the air resistance. Write down the horizontal speed and the corresponding force of air resistance. Do this at least four times, noting your data each time. For best results, try a wide variety of thrust forces (one that is quite low, one that is quite high, and a couple in the middle, for example). When you are done, graph the helicopter’s velocity versus the force of air resistance on a separate sheet of paper. State the velocity, in m/s, on the y axis and the force of air resistance, in newtons, on the x axis. Then, return here to answer some follow-up questions.

How does the force of air resistance vary with the speed of the helicopter? Does the force of air resistance increase as helicopter speed increases, decrease as helicopter speed increases, stay the same, or is there no relationship at all? Use your data to justify your answer.     7. Using the guidelines above, is the relationship between air resistance force and helicopter speed a linear, inverse, or squared relationship? Or is there no relationship at all? Justify your answer using your data. For reminders on how to establish a relationship between two variables, click here.     Exercise 5: Flying your helicopter To fly a helicopter you need more than just vertical lift force − you need to be able to fly it forward and backward as well. In this exercise, you can also apply a horizontal force − called a thrust force. Again your helicopter is sitting on the launch pad, as shown in the picture below. Your challenge in this exercise is to fly the helicopter from the left landing pad and land it − softly − on the second landing pad to the right. We have “turned off” air resistance once again, so you need not factor it into this exercise or the following one.   Exercise 5. Practice takeoffs and landings with the helicopter.  You continue to control the lift force by pressing the up and down arrow keys. You control the horizontal thrust force by pressing the right and left arrow keys. Pressing the right arrow key adds 250 N of force directed horizontally to the right. Press the left arrow key, and 250 N of horizontal force is subtracted. A negative thrust is directed horizontally to the left. The range of thrust force is −5000 N to +5000 N. A gauge on the control panel displays the total thrust force at any moment.  When you open the simulation, you again will see your helicopter sitting on a landing pad. Use the up and down arrows on the computer keyboard to move the helicopter off the pad and into the air. Then, using the thrust keys − the right and left arrow buttons on the computer keyboard − maneuver the helicopter over to the second landing pad. You need to lift the helicopter off the ground before you can fly it horizontally. Finally, pilot the helicopter so that it makes a soft landing on the second pad. As you fly about, keep an eye on the gauges on the control panel. The lift force and thrust force are both displayed. You also have output gauges for the horizontal and vertical components of the velocity and acceleration.  Click here to open the Exercise 5 Simulation  8. What horizontal thrust force is required for the helicopter to have zero horizontal velocity? To be moving at a constant horizontal velocity?

Objectscan exert forces on other objects without direct contact. The gravitational force is one of the fundamental forces in the universe, and we would all be flying off the surface of the Earth without it. The topic of gravity has played a starring role in some of the most famous tales in the history of physics. Galileo Galilei was studying the acceleration due to the Earth’s gravity when he dropped two balls from the Leaning Tower of Pisa. A theory to explain the force of gravity came to Isaac Newton shortly after an apple fell from a tree and knocked him in the head. Although historians doubt whether these events actually occurred, the stories have come to symbolize how a simple experiment or a sudden moment of insight can lead to important and lasting scientific progress. As with other forces, a gravitational force has both strength (magnitude) and direction. The amount of gravitational force between two objects depends on the amount of their masses and on the distance between them.   Exercise 1: Gravitational force and mass In this exercise, you will make measurements of the gravitational attraction between two spheres to see how the force of gravity relates to the mass of an object. Mass is the quantity of matter and determines how much it will resist a change in velocity.    Exercise 1. Force and mass  There are two masses in the simulation. One of them is the Earth, with a mass of 5.97×1024 kg. The other is a small satellite of Earth’s. Its mass starts at 10 kilograms but you can vary it. You may also vary the separation between their centers, either by clicking and dragging, or by using the up-down arrows, but you will take advantage of that in the next exercise. In this one, keep the distance constant. The attractive force between the masses is shown in the force readout. Each object exerts the same magnitude of force on the other, by Newton’s third law.

Is the relationship linear (are the points on a line?). There can be some error in the data, so if not sure, plot a few more points.     Exercise 2: Force and distance In this exercise, you will make measurements of the gravitational attraction between two spheres to see how the force of gravity relates to the distance between their centers.   Exercise 2. Force and distance  There are two masses in the simulation. One of them is the Earth, with a mass of 5.97×1024 kg. The other is a small satellite of Earth’s. Its mass starts at 10 kilograms, and in this exercise you will leave it fixed. You may vary the separation between their centers, either by clicking and dragging, or by using the up-down arrows. Clicking and dragging lets you alter the distance quickly; the arrows offer precision control. The attractive force between the masses is shown in the force readout.

You will also measure the gravitational constant, G.    Exercise 3. Measuring gravitational attraction.  Use the simulation to answer the questions below.

Suppose you place a 1.0 kg mass right at the surface of the Earth, and measure the magnitude of the attractive force. Look at the mathematical form of Newton’s law of gravitation. What do you predict will happen if one of the two masses is doubled? To check your hypothesis, measure the attractive forces toward the Earth for a 1.0 kg and a 2.0 kg mass at its surface.

The two situations just described correspond to a 1.0 kg and a 2.0 kg mass, respectively, located at the surface of the Earth. Explain why the resulting force values look familiar.     10. Now that you have confirmed the form of Newton’s law of gravity, use any of your data points to determine the gravitational constant, G.     The value you calculated should be close to the value we use in the lab for G. The lab uses an approximation for consistency with typical 3-digit calculations.    Exercise 4 (optional): Gravity and motion Gravity and motion is an important topic because gravity determines the orbits of satellites. The next two exercises allow you some brief experiments. In the simulation in this exercise, there are three identical red masses of mass m. The green mass is twice as massive as the red, and the blue mass is four times as massive.  You can start your experimentation by dragging two masses onto the screen. The purple arrow represent the gravitational forces between them. The arrow points in the direction of the force. The longer the arrow, the greater the force. You can move a mass around the screen and see how the gravitational forces change.   Use the simulation to answer the questions below. You will drag out different masses. Press GO to make the bodies move. Click here to enter the Exercise 4 Simulation  11.

They use the model of an ideal gas to relate important properties of a gas, such as its temperature and the kinetic energy of the molecules that make it up. The “ideal gas law” relates a gas’s pressure, its volume, the number of particles in the gas, and its temperature. What is an ideal gas? An ideal gas consists of a large number of atoms or molecules. (We will from now on just refer to the particles that make up the gas as “molecules” for simplicity’s sake, although there are monatomic gases like neon.) They are separated on average by distances large relative to the size of a molecule. They move at high speeds and collide frequently. Using descriptions like “large” and “frequently” does not convey the nature of gases as well as specific numbers. Consider nitrogen molecules (N2), the most common molecule in our atmosphere. In one cubic meter of nitrogen molecules at standard pressure and temperature, there are 2.69 × 1025molecules. They occupy just 0.07% of the space and move at an average speed of 454 m/s. The molecules run into one another a lot: There are 9.9 × 1034 collisions each second in that space. The molecules collide elastically both with each other and the container walls. The molecules only exert forces on one another when they collide; other longer range forces are negligible.  Each molecule can be considered as a small, hard sphere. In elastic collisions, overall kinetic energy and momentum are both conserved. The velocities of the molecules change after a collision, but the total momentum and kinetic energy of the molecules remain the same.  The walls of the container are assumed to be rigid. When a molecule collides with a wall, its speed does not change although its velocity does (because its direction changed). Standard Newtonian physics can be used to analyze the collisions of the molecules with each other and with the walls of the container.  We use a pool table and pool balls to illustrate and model an ideal gas. The pool balls collide elastically, like the molecules in an ideal gas, and they only interact with one another via collisions. We ignore other forces like friction and air resistance. In this lab, you conduct a series of experiments. You can answer questions such as: How does the speed of individual gas molecules vary over time? What happens to the pressure of a gas if you reduce the size of the container? What happens if you add more molecules?  You will learn: What happens to molecules that are allowed to collide under ideal conditions How a distribution curve describes the behavior of ideal gas molecules The ideal gas law (the relationship between pressure, volume, temperature and the number of molecules in a quantity of gas)   Exercise 1: Simulating an ideal gas This exercise simulates how molecules interact under ideal conditions. The simulation, pictured below, is a container with eight balls, each of which represents a gas molecule. All the molecules in the simulation are the same; they have identical masses and sizes.   Exercise 1. Simulating an ideal gas.  When you start the simulation, the molecules will be moving at the same speed but in randomly set directions. They will move around the container, bouncing off the walls and each other. All collisions − between two molecules or between a molecule and a wall − are perfectly elastic, meaning there is no kinetic energy lost in the collisions. A molecule will rebound off a wall with exactly the same speed as it had coming in. When two molecules collide, some kinetic energy may transfer from one molecule to another, but the sum of their kinetic energies remains the same.  There is no friction, and no other forces come into play. You can think of the molecules you will see in the simulation as magnified and moving in slow motion. While the simulation accurately models the behavior of an ideal gas, it is important to keep in mind that a typical gas found in nature consists of billions or trillions of particles, each moving at extraordinarily high speeds. A single breath of fresh air at typical room temperature and pressure contains approximately 4.3×1022 molecules! This simulation displays the speed of each molecule. The speed readings are presented in meters per second, and these are the values you should use in any calculations. However, the actual movement of the molecules on screen has been slowed by roughly a billion; it would be impossible to see the molecules if they were shown at their actual size and speeds. Before you start the simulation, think about the setup and imagine what will happen once the molecules start moving and colliding with one another and the edges of the container.  1. The molecules start out with identical speeds. After the molecules have been moving − and colliding − for about 15 seconds, do you think the molecules will still have the same speed, or will they have varying speeds? Explain your prediction.     Test your answer in the simulation. When the simulation opens, press the GO button in the control panel to start the molecules moving.  Note the readout gauges that display the speed of each individual molecule at every instant. Use the PAUSE button to freeze the simulation at any point to more easily read the speed gauges. Pressing the PAUSE button again restarts the action. You can pause the simulation as many times as you like.  You can also rerun the simulation from the beginning by pressing RESET. Hit RESET to clear the simulation, then GO to run it again.  When you are done, return here to answer some follow-up questions. Click here to enter the Exercise 1 Simulation  2. Was your prediction correct? After the simulation has run for several seconds, do the speeds of the molecules vary over a wide range, or do they all eventually achieve about the same speed?     3. Do you think the average KE of the molecules stays the same over time? What about the average speed? Record the data now and perform the calculations later as a homework assignment. To simplify matters, ignore the mass of the molecules in the expression ½ mv2 (since it is the same for all molecules) when calculating the average KE − in other words, the average kinetic energy is just a constant times the average value of v2. You can determine whether the KE changes by seeing whether the square of the speed stays the same or changes.  To see if the average KE and the average speed have changed, it is simplest to use the initial conditions (when all the molecules are moving at the same speed) as one of your data points. Then record the speeds of the molecules after you have run the simulation for several seconds.    SpeedSpeed squared  Molecule 1     Molecule 2     Molecule 3     Molecule 4      Molecule 5      Molecule 6      Molecule 7      Molecule 8      AVERAGE        4. Is there a physics principle that leads you to believe that the average KE should stay the same?     Exercise 2: Speed distribution You probably noticed that once the molecules in the simulation start colliding, the speeds of the various molecules changed, and continued to change. Why? Imagine you are a gas molecule traveling due north at 150 meters per second, and another molecule traveling in a different direction collides with you. Your direction and speed afterwards may not be the same as they were before.  The speed of an ideal gas molecule changes many times every second. Recording the data continuously is time-consuming, and displaying it numerically would be overwhelming. The simulation below includes a graphing feature to chart the pattern of speeds of the molecules, which makes it simpler to see patterns.  The graph displays ranges of molecular speed on the x axis, and the percentage of molecules traveling in those speed ranges on the y axis. The simulation updates the speeds of the molecules about 20 times each second, and displays the cumulative data recorded from the beginning of the simulation. The software program is creating what is called a distribution curve; it shows the percentage of molecules moving at various speed ranges.  This simulation contains an ideal gas similar to the one in Exercise 1. We have increased the number of gas molecules to 50. The gas molecules all start at the same speed, 240 m/s, but again, their initial directions are random. Again, though the speeds presented are in m/s, the motion on the screen is slowed by a factor of one billion. Every time there is a collision between gas molecules, the graph updates the data for those molecules. In this fashion, the graph will present a picture of patterns in the molecular speeds.  In the simulation, press GO on the control panel to start the molecules moving. Observe the graph in the simulation window. Give the simulation about 40 seconds to generate enough data so that the graph reaches a near steady state. (If you have a chance, let it run for thirty minutes or so for the “perfect” graph.) As before, you can freeze the action by pressing PAUSE. You can run the simulation again by pressing RESET to clear it, then GO to start. When you are done, return here to answer some follow-up questions. Click here to enter the Exercise 2 Simulation  5. Describe the general characteristics of the graph. Is the likelihood of a molecule moving within each range of speeds exactly the same, or are some ranges more probable than others?    6. You may have seen symmetrical distribution curves, such the one representing a normal distribution. A normal distribution can be approximated in many ways, such as by flipping 1000 pennies, and noting how often they come up 1000 heads, or 999 heads and a tail, or 998 heads and 2 tails, and so on up to 1000 tails. The likelihood of N number of tails is the same as the likelihood for N number of heads, so such a graph would be symmetric about the “500 heads, 500 tails”.  Is the graph of the molecules’ speeds symmetrical? If the curve in this simulation is not symmetrical, describe it, with a focus on the behavior of the curve at higher speed ranges.    The graph you saw is called a Maxwell distribution curve. It is named after James Clerk Maxwell, a British physicist in the 19th century whose achievements include developing statistical methods for modeling gases. One characteristic of this curve you may have noted is the long “tail” to the right. Some molecules are moving quite rapidly compared to the average speed of the gas. This property of a gas (and other substances) is quite important. This type of distribution can be used to explain other phenomena, like evaporation in a liquid. The speed of the water molecules is distributed, and those moving fast enough will evaporate. Not all the molecules evaporate at the same time because their speeds are not the same. Evaporation is a cooling process, as you no doubt have experienced after stepping out of the shower, because the molecules with the greatest speed (and KE) leave, reducing the average KE of the molecules that remain behind.   Exercise 3: Temperature and average molecular speed You now will study the “macroscopic” properties of a gas; these are overall properties of a quantity of gas, such as its pressure or volume, as opposed to “microscopic” properties, such as the speed of its individual molecules. To start this transition, you will explore how changing the temperature of a gas affects the speed of its molecules. You will observe the relationship qualitatively, and also develop a mathematical relationship for how temperature changes affect molecular speed. After this exercise, you will experiment with the relationship between the average speed of a molecule and the pressure of the gas.  Start the simulation by pressing GO. Then change the temperature of the gas by clicking the up or down arrows on the temperature dial in the control panel. The temperature is displayed in kelvins (K) and ranges from 100 K to 600 K. The simulation will calculate the average speed of the molecules (vavg) and display it in a gauge on the control panel. The purpose of the exercise is to determine the relationship between the temperature and average molecular speed in an ideal gas. Pick a temperature and record the average speed of the gas molecules. Then change the temperature value and record the new average speed. Repeat this at least five times over a wide range of temperatures; you want enough data to determine the relationship between the two variables. You will note that the output gauge for the average speed shows that this value fluctuates even while the temperature is held constant. This is not a bug; it accurately reflects the average speed. In terms of recording data, look at the gauge and make an approximation of what the average speed is for a given temperature. The average speed varies on the order of 5 to 10%. This is a good reason to record several data points. Pressing PAUSE enables you to read the data more easily. Data in real world experiments may have error or “noise”, and this computer simulation is no different. We have deliberately avoided creating “ideal” data, in order to expose you to the realities of laboratory work. (Why does the average speed vary? One answer is: What principle of physics says it cannot? Earlier questions in this lab asked you to average both the KE (proportional to the speed squared) and the speed. You might ponder the data and conclusions you reach there in order to understand why the average speed changes. There is another average that physicists use, the root-mean-square (emphasis added). If we displayed that average, you would see less “jitter” in the data.) Using your own graph paper, graph the temperature, T, on the y axis, and the average speed of the gas molecules (vavg), in m/s, on the x axis. When you are done collecting and graphing your data, return here to answer some follow-up questions. Click here to enter the Exercise 3 Simulation Analyze your data. Create a graph in which temperature, in kelvins, is on the y axis and average speed of the gas molecules, in m/s, is on the x axis.   7. Based on your data, did the average speed of the gas molecules increase, decrease or stay the same as the temperature of the gas increased?    Using your graph and data set, try to determine the mathematical relationship between temperature and molecular speed. Your goal is to determine a relationship between the two variables (i.e. linear, inverse, squared, no relationship at all, etc.). For tips on how to establish a relationship from your graph, click here.  8. Write an equation for the relationship between temperature (T) and average molecular speed (vavg) in a gas (which may contain a numerical constant). Also describe the relationship in words.     Exercise 4: Pressure and temperature  The goal of this exercise and the two that follow is to collect data and graph the relationships between gas pressure (P) and three other macroscopic properties of a gas: its temperature (T), its volume (V) and the number of particles contained in the gas (N). The ultimate goal is to describe an ideal gas with a single equation relating the macroscopic variables P, V, N and T. This is the subject of Exercise 7. Exercise 4 asks this question: What happens, if anything, to the pressure of a gas when its temperature increases? The other properties of the gas, its volume and number of molecules, are held constant so you can focus on this relationship. Use the ideal gas simulator to find out.  You can set the temperature of the gas as you did before, by clicking the up or down arrows on the temperature dial in the control panel. The temperature ranges from 100 K to 600 K. A separate gauge displays the gas pressure, in pascals (Pa). Inside of a 3-D box, the average force per unit area exerted by bouncing molecules on the walls is called pressure. Generally, the more often molecules collide with the walls, the greater the pressure. The simulation measures pressure by calculating the force with which the molecules collide with the walls of the container, and then dividing by the surface area of the walls. (NOTE: You can only see two dimensions in the simulation. An unseen third dimension is present in the simulation to create the volume shown in the output gauge.) The purpose of this exercise is to find the relationship between the temperature and pressure of an ideal gas, when other variables (such as volume) are held constant. Start the simulation by pressing GO, and then record the temperature and pressure of the gas. Change the temperature and record another pair of data points. Repeat this at least five times until you have enough data to graph the relationship between gas temperature and pressure. In the graph, place pressure P in pascals (Pa) on the y axis, and temperature T, in kelvins (K), on the x axis. You can use the PAUSE button to freeze the simulation at any point to more easily read the pressure gauge. Again, you will see fluctuations in the pressure at a given temperature. This occurs for the same reason that the average speed fluctuated. These fluctuations are smaller at lower temperatures. By pressing PAUSE several times, you can make a better estimate of the average pressure at a given temperature. When you are done collecting and graphing your data, return here to answer some questions. Click here to enter the Exercise 4 Simulation  9.  Look at your data. Did the average pressure of the gas increase, decrease or stay the same as the temperature of the gas increased?     10.Using the data set and graph, establish a relationship between the variables P and T. Is the relationship linear, inverse or squared? Write an equation with the variables P, T, and C1 (C1 is your first constant).     11. Provide an explanation as to what happens on the molecular level to cause the pressure-temperature relationship you recorded. Consider how the increased speed of the molecules affects the collisions of the molecules with the walls.      Exercise 5: Pressure and volume What happens, if anything, to the pressure of a gas when its volume increases, while temperature and the number of molecules are kept constant? Use the ideal gas simulator to find out. In this exercise, the temperature is held constant, but you can vary the volume of the ideal gas, by use of the piston shown in the picture below.   Exercise 5. Use the piston to find how gas pressure changes with volume.  Assume the temperature is constant. In an actual lab situation, the temperature can be held constant by taking away or adding (as in this case) energy in the form of heat. This heat transfer is not shown in this simulation.  You can set the volume of the gas by clicking the up or down arrows on the volume dial on the control panel. The volume is small at all times; at the container’s maximum, it is 3.2×10-22 m3. We use such a small volume to get “reasonable” pressure readings given the small number of molecules we simulate. The simulation will move the piston up to increase the container's volume, and down to decrease it. The purpose of this exercise is for you to determine the relationship between the pressure and the volume of an ideal gas, assuming the other variables are fixed. Start the simulation by pressing GO and then record the volume and pressure of the gas. Change the volume and record another pair of data points. Repeat at least five times until you have enough data to graph the relationship between pressure and gas volume. You can use the PAUSE button to freeze the simulation at any point to more easily read the pressure gauge. Again, the pressure will fluctuate at a given volume. In the graph, place pressure, in pascals, on the y axis, and volume, in 10-22 m3, on the x axis When you are done collecting and graphing your data, return here to answer some follow-up questions. Click here to enter the Exercise 5 Simulation  12. Did the average pressure of the gas increase, decrease or stay the same as the volume of the gas increased?    13. Using your data set and graph, establish a relationship, if any exists, between the variables P and V. Is the relationship linear, inverse or squared? Write an equation using the variables P, V, and C2 (for the second constant you are using in your equation).     14. Why does changing the volume of an ideal gas (at fixed temperature and number of molecules) change the pressure? Looking at the simulation with the volume set at different values provides a visual context for answering this question.      Exercise 6: Pressure and number of molecules, N What happens, if anything, to the pressure of a gas when more molecules are introduced into the container? Use the ideal gas simulator to find out. You can vary the number of gas molecules in this simulation. In real life, adding molecules might affect pressure, volume or temperature. Here, volume and temperature will be held constant, so pressure is the only variable that can change as you alter the number of molecules. This is equivalent to making two assumptions. First, that the box is very rigid so that a pressure change will not cause a volume change. Second, that the molecules that are introduced come from a gas with the same temperature as the gas already in the container. If you remove molecules, the temperature also remains unchanged.   You can set the number of molecules in the gas by clicking the up or down arrows on the “number of molecules” dial in the control panel. The range for the number of molecules is 10 to 40. The purpose of this exercise is to find the relationship between the pressure and the number of molecules in an ideal gas. Start the simulation by pressing GO and then record the number of molecules and the pressure. Add some molecules and record another pair of data points. Repeat at least five times until you have enough data to make a graph of the relationship between the number of molecules and pressure. You can also use the PAUSE button to freeze the simulation at any point to more easily read the pressure gauge. As with the earlier exercises, there will be fluctuations in the pressure you observe. In the graph, place pressure in pascals (Pa) on the y axis, and number of molecules, N, on the x axis. When you are done collecting and graphing your data, return here to answer some follow-up questions. Click here to enter the Exercise 6 Simulation  15. Did the average pressure of the gas increase, decrease or stay the same as the number of molecules increased?    16.  Using your data set and graph, establish a relationship, if any exists, between the variables P and N. Is the relationship linear, inverse or squared? Write an equation using the variables P, N, and C3 (for the third constant in your equations).

The electric force is one of the fundamental forces in the universe, and examples of it may be found literally everywhere, from televisions where electrically charged plates steer beams of electrons to strike the screen, to the interior of atoms where the electric attraction between the positive nucleus and the negative electrons helps to hold them together. As with other forces, an electric force has both strength (magnitude) and direction. The amount of electrostatic force between two charged particles depends on the strength of the charges and on the distance between them, and the direction of the force is determined by their positions and the sign of their charges. After your initial work on charges, it will be time for some play. You will take a trip to a miniature electric golf course.  Exercise 1: Sign and direction of force You will start by using a simulation with two spheres that are electrically charged in order to see how the direction of the force between two charged particles depends on the signs of the charges. The basic setup of the simulation is shown below. As you can see, the charged spheres are different colors. The force the blue charged sphere exerts on the orange charged sphere is shown with a blue arrow. The force the orange sphere exerts on the blue sphere is shown with an orange arrow. The arrow points in the direction of the force. The longer the arrow, the greater the amount of the force. You can see that the charged spheres repel each other. By repel, we mean the forces push them apart.   Exercise 1. Drag the two spheres out and investigate the direction of the electric forces.   First, think of a few experiments. How might you determine if two charges with the same sign attract or repel one another? What experiment might you conduct to see if two charges with the different signs attract one another, or if they repel one another?   Launch the simulation by clicking on the orange button labeled Exercise 1. After you launch it, set the amount of charge by using the up-down arrows next to the numbers. The amount of charge is a multiple of 10-12 coulombs, 0.00000000001 coulombs. Even though this seems like a small amount of charge, it would take millions of electrons or protons to create the amount of charge used in these simulations.  Both charges start at zero, so if you press the up arrow at first, you create a positive number, and a positive charge. If you press the down arrow at first, you will have a negative number, which means you have created a negative charge. Example: If you click up to a charge equaling “4,” then you have loaded the sphere with a total positive charge of 4.0×10-12 coulombs. If you click down to a charge of “−5,” then you have loaded the sphere with negative 5.0×10-12 coulombs.  Drag out the charges. Change their signs to positive and negative to answer the questions below. Click here to enter the Exercise 1 Simulation  1.Create two positive charges. The numbers in the gray boxes should both be positive. Do the arrows on the charges point toward each other, or do they point away from each other? (Hint: If you cannot see the arrows, pull the spheres farther apart, to put more distance between them, or reduce the amount of charge.)    2.Create two negative charges. The numbers in the gray boxes should both be negative. Do the arrows on the charges point toward each other, or away? (Hint: If you cannot see the arrows, pull the spheres farther apart, to put more distance between them, or reduce the amount of charge.)    3.Create a positive and a negative charge. Do the arrows point toward each other, or do they point away from each other?    4.Do like charges, charges with the same sign, attract each other, or repel each other?    5.Do opposite charges, charges with different signs, attract each other, or repel each other?    6.Design an experiment to answer this question: is there an electrostatic force between a sphere with no charge, and one with a charge? Describe your experiment and the results.     Exercise 2: How electric forces change with distance You use the same simulation to see how the electric force strength changes with the distance between the charges. You are going to establish the precise relationship between force, distance and charge.   Exercise 2. How electric forces change with distance Before you proceed, first consider and predict whether you expect the electric force to stay the same, become weaker, or become stronger when the charges are moved farther apart. To determine the relationship between the amount of force one charge exerts on the other and the distance between these charges, you will need to record data.  After you launch the simulation, drag the two large charged spheres from the control panel to the area above. An output gauge in the control panel labeled “Distance between charges” displays how far the center of one sphere is from the other. You can change the amount of charge on the spheres in the simulation, but you should not do so in this exercise. Collect five data points at various separations so that you will have enough data to create and to analyze a force versus distance graph. Record the force at a given separation, then drag one sphere to change the distance between them and record the force for this new distance. Get a variety of distances. For instance, about 1 grid box apart, then 3 grid boxes apart, then 5, 7 and 9. You will find it useful to record your distances and forces in scientific notation. When you are done recording data, return here to answer two follow-up questions. Click here to enter the Exercise 2 Simulation  Complete the table below   DistanceForce  Data point 1  m  N  Data point 2  m  N  Data point 3  m  N  Data point 4  m  N  Data point 5  m  N    7.In general, does the amount of force increase, decrease or does it stay the same as the distance increases?    8.Graph the relationship between distance and force. A graphing calculator or a spreadsheet may be very helpful. Graph the amount of force on the vertical axis and the distance on the horizontal. Is the relationship linear (are all the points on a line) or not?    9.What is the relationship between the forces that the charged spheres exert on one another? In other words, is the force the blue sphere exerts on the orange sphere equal in amount to that exerted by the orange on the blue, or does it differ? What law of Newton can you cite that confirms your conclusions?     Exercise 3: How the charge values affect the force  You learned how the amount of electric force depends on the distance between the charges. Did you conclude that the electric force should get weaker with distance? Perhaps you thought about what would happen if the electric force got stronger with distance. It would be a strange universe indeed − for example, the flight paths of electrons in your TV set would be affected more by your neighbor’s TV set than your own! Or, in this case, two charges on opposite sides of the galaxy would exert incredible amounts of force on one another. Alternatively, you may have turned to your everyday experience to answer the question. For example, when you take out two laundry items fresh from the dryer that want to stick together (the dreaded “static cling”), separating the two pieces reduces their attractive force. In this exercise, you will investigate what happens to the amount of force when the amount of one change changes. For example, what happens if the amount of one charge doubles? Triples? To do so, you will proceed in a fashion very similar to the one you used to determine the relationship of force and distance. You will set the charges, record the value for the force, and then change the value of one charge, and again record the force.  To do this, you will change the value of one charge at a time. The data table below assumes you hold one charge constant and vary the other. You will record the data, and then answer the same question as before. Is the force proportional to q1? Or is the force inversely proportional, and so on.   Exercise 3. Change the amounts of the two stationary charges and investigate the strength and direction of the electric forces.  In the simulation, two spheres start with an initial distance of 1.0 x 10-6 meters between their centers. Keep this distance the same since you only want to change the amount of charge. As before, in the control panel you see two up-down controls that change the amount of charge on the corresponding sphere. By clicking on the arrows you set the positive or negative charge on each sphere. Just change the amount of charge on one sphere, not on both of them!   Click here to enter the Exercise 3 Simulation  Complete the table below   ChargeForce  Data point 1  C  N  Data point 2  C  N  Data point 3  C  N  Data point 4  C  N  Data point 5  C  N    10. When you increase the amount of charge, does the force increase, decrease, or stay the same?    11.Graph your data, force versus charge. Are the points linear (on a line), or not? There may be some amount of error in your data. If you are not sure, try changing the amount of charge several more times, and adding those data points to the graph.     Exercise 4: Electric golf − the practice green  After golfing legend Bobby Jones watched Jack Nicklaus demolish the competition at the Masters tournament in 1965, he uttered the famous quip, “He plays a game with which I am not familiar.” Well, today, you will play a game with which even Nicklaus himself is unfamiliar: electric golf.  In the next several exercises, you will use the electric force on a charged golf ball to move it around a course. The greater the force, the faster the ball moves initially. By the end, you may be so skilled at calibrating this force that you can score a hole-in-one every time!  The putter is unique − it is a massive wand that you load with charge. You load the club head with positively charged protons or negatively-charged electrons. A proton has a charge of positive 1.6 x 10−19 coulombs. An electron has a charge of negative 1.6×10−19 coulombs. The golf ball has a net charge equal to the charge of one proton.    Exercise 4. Putt the charged golf ball into the cup using your charged putter. As you load the very massive club head with charge, the putter and ball immediately exert forces on each other. (The vector arrow shown above indicates the direction and magnitude of the force of the putter on the ball; we do not display the equal but opposite force on the putter.) The ball will stay “frozen” in place until you push the PUTT button in the simulation.  This golf course has friction, which causes the ball to slow and roll to a stop. When you push PUTT, the ball will move across the course. Its acceleration (and velocity) will depend on the amount and direction of the net force on it. After the ball stops moving, the ball again is frozen in place, which allows you to set up for your next shot. Otherwise, the ball would begin to move as you increased the charge in the putter, or moved the putter closer to the ball. You press PUTT when you are ready to take your next shot.   This first exercise is just for practice. Do not worry about exactly how much force the putter exerts on the golf ball. Use trial and error to sink the ball. You will make more precise calculations later. On this first practice green, the putter is positioned a fixed distance from the ball. Your challenge is to get the ball to move across the green − hopefully into the cup − by loading the putter with charges. You will only get one putt, so if the putt doesn’t drop, press RESET and try again. (For extra fun, you can try scoring a hole-in-one after a rebound from the back wall.)  Click here to enter the Exercise 4 Simulation   Exercise 5: Electric golf: Q-school  You are in the Q-school, the notoriously challenging school of the PGA (Proton Golf Association), to qualify to play on the professional golf tour. Now, armed with Coulomb’s law, you should be able use your physics knowledge to score a hole-in-one.   Exercise 5. Score a hole-in-one using your knowledge of Coulomb’s Law. For this hole, if the putter exerts an initial force of 8.2×10−26 newtons on the charged ball, the ball will plop precisely into the cup. Trust us.  If the initial force is lower than this figure, the ball will stop short of the hole. If the initial force is higher, the ball will overshoot the hole and fall into the water trap, taking your hopes and dreams with it.  The challenge is to use Coulomb’s law and program the putter to impart exactly the right amount of initial force on the ball. You set both the charge on the putter and the distance between the charged putter and the charged ball. HINT: It may be easier to pick a value for the amount of charge, and then calculate the distance. As before, the amount of putter charge must be in increments of the charge of a proton.  Use Coulomb’s Law to calculate how much charge to load onto the putter and how far away to place the putter from the ball in order to impart the desired force.  Enter a value for charge on the putter by clicking on the up or down arrows. It is important to remember that each proton you load onto your putter has a charge of +1.6×10−19 coulombs. Enter a value for the distance between the putter and the ball, in meters, in the control panel. In this exercise, you cannot move the putter by clicking and dragging the golfer.  If you think you have the right combination of charge and distance, press PUTT to release the charged ball. If you fail to sink the putt, press RESET, adjust the values accordingly and try again. Nothing less than a hole-in-one will do to graduate from Q-school, to receive your card, and to play the world tour.  When you are done, return here to answer some follow-up questions. Click here to enter the Exercise 5 Simulation  14. What combination of charge and distance did you use to impart an initial force of 8.2×10−26 N to the ball?     15. Your golf ball is a single proton, so it has a mass of 1.67×10−27 kilograms. Assuming that the 8.2×10−26 N force you applied to the ball was nearly instantaneous − as it would be with a real golf club hitting a ball − and ignoring friction, what was the initial acceleration of the ball?     Exercise 6: Electric golf − the world tour Now that you have graduated from Q-school, you are ready for the masters. You are playing solely for pride, and love of physics - there are no monetary rewards. In fact, there will even be a charge to play (1.6×10−19 coulombs, to be exact). Please mail in one proton to us.  As before, you set the amount of charge on the putter and you can move the charged putter closer to or farther away from the charged proton ball. In addition, you can now rotate the golfer to aim the ball. A gauge in the control panel displays how far the putter is from the ball.  For an extra challenge, some of the courses are dotted with clumps of positive and negative charges, marked with plus signs or minus signs. The amount of charge on the obstacles is indicated. You will find that your proton ball has a very strong reaction to these clumps of charges, sometimes from a great distance away!  All the obstacles are point charges. The shape of an obstacle − like a sand trap − is intended to give you a visual image only. The amount of charge in an obstacle is quantified as a multiple of e, the elementary charge. The elementary charge equals 1.6×10−19 C, the magnitude of charge of a proton or an electron.  There also are hills. Again, the outline of the hill is just a visual metaphor, not a precise depiction of the forces. When you press GO, the ball will be released, and propelled from the charged putter to move under the influence of friction, the putter, and any other electric forces that act on it.    Exercise 6. Putt the charged ball into the cup using your charged putter − but watch out for the sand traps and the hills!  Once the ball comes to a stop, it is held in place so you can click and drag the putter over to the ball for your next stroke. Position the putter, enter a new value for its charge if you wish, then press PUTT. You can keep putting until you get the ball in the cup.  To summarize the physics, you change the force you exert on the charged ball by: Changing the amount and sign of the charge on the putter. Changing the distance between putter and ball. You can aim your shots by changing the angle between the putter and the ball. So go play! Try to complete a five-hole course in the fewest number of strokes. A stroke counter will keep track of your progress across all the holes.   The simulation link buttons below lead you to five different miniature golf holes. To assist you with the diabolical charged sandtraps and hills, some holes show electric field lines. If you have not yet studied electric fields, the instructions that follow may be a little cryptic, but will serve as an introduction to the topic. The electric field shown is created by the charged obstacles. These lines provide a visual outline of the overall electric field caused by the multiple charged obstacles. The field lines point in the direction of the net electric field created by the obstacles. The closer together they are, the stronger the field. The force on the golf ball equals its net charge times the electric field. For a positive charge, the electric field points in the same direction as the force. In sum, if you see a group of field lines closely clustered, you should expect your golf ball to experience a strong force there, roughly in the direction of those field lines.  You can use the field lines in a manner analogous to how a real golfer reads the rise and fall of a green to determine where and how hard to putt the ball. Take advantage of the field lines to predict how the charged golf ball will behave as it moves across the green.  For the scorecard to work, you must play and complete the first hole first. If you play the first hole a second time, we assume you are playing a new round (starting over). To go on to a subsequent hole, hit “Next hole” after you have sunk your putt. You can play any hole by clicking on the appropriate button below.  You can also replay any hole you like by pushing the RESET button while playing that hole. Pressing RESET returns the ball to its initial point and clears the stroke counter to zero for that hole. Pressing RESET does not restart the course, just that hole.  Click below for Hole No. 1 Hole No. 2 Hole No. 3 Hole No. 4 Hole No. 5  16. After you pressed PUTT, did the ball initially head off in the approximate direction of the force exerted on it by the putter?    15.  Did the ball always continue moving straight along that direction? Why or why not?

They are caused by vibrations. These vibrations range from the small − the quivering of your vocal cords as you whisper to a friend − to the enormous, such as seismic vibrations in the Earth that can cause 30-meter-tall waves in the ocean. In this lab, you will study some of the fundamental principles of mechanical waves by studying a wave on a wire.   This lab covers the following topics: Mechanical waves Some properties that describe a wave: amplitude, wavelength, frequency, period and wave speed The mathematical equation for a transverse wave   Exercise 1: A wave in a wire Imagine you are bird − a claustrophobic bird. You like to have room to spread your wings. Sometimes it gets crowded up on those telephone wires. All you want is to enjoy your favorite stretch of wire, but it is filled with other birds. So you hope to knock them off. With a wave.   Exercise 1. Create a single wave pulse to knock the birds off the wire.  You are the red parrot sitting on the wire nearest to the pole. You want to knock the other birds off the wire. You will create a wave pulse in the wire by jiggling it. Each time you yank it up and push it down, you create a wave pulse that will, you hope, dislodge some of your rivals.  Some of them may get annoyed and fly off at the slightest disturbance. Others are more stubborn. You will have to make waves with a variety of heights to knock them all off. The height of a wave − its maximum positive displacement from the equilibrium, or rest, position − is called its amplitude. It is often easiest to calculate the displacement by noting the height of a wave peak above the rest point of the wire.   Open the simulation. Press GO to create a wave pulse in the wire. At any time you can press PAUSE to freeze the wave. Pressing PAUSE again will restart the action. Press RESET to start over. There is a grid in the simulation that will prove useful in answering various questions. Each side of a square that makes up the grid is 0.25 m.  If that first wave pulse did not knock the birds off the wire, you can vary the wave’s amplitude, using the up-down button on the control panel. Use the arrows in the simulation to set the amplitude. Press GO to send another wave pulse down the wire. As you create wave pulses in the wire, note their direction of travel. Also, consider whether the wire itself travels left or right.  When you are done, return here to answer some follow-up questions. Click here to open the Exercise 1 Simulation  1.  How does the amplitude relate to the height of a peak? To the depth of a trough? (A peak is the highest point of a wave or wave pulse above equilibrium, and a trough is the lowest point of a wave or wave pulse below equilibrium.) Remember that each box in the grid in the simulation is 0.25 m tall.     2. Did the wave pulses created by the red parrot travel along the wire? If so, in what direction did they travel? How does the direction of the red parrot’s motion in creating the wave pulse relate to the direction of travel of the wave pulse (are they parallel or perpendicular to one another)?    3. Does the wire itself move over time? For instance, does it move to the left or right? How about a particle that makes up the wire − in what direction(s) does it move as a wave pulse passes through its location?      Exercise 2: Continuous waves In Exercise 1, you created a single wave pulse by pushing and pulling the wire perpendicular to the direction along which the wave pulse then traveled. You created a transverse wave pulse − a wave pulse in which the particles of the medium vibrate perpendicular to the direction the wave pulse travels. The bird pushed and pulled the particles of the telephone wire up and down vertically, while the wave traveled horizontally to the right. The particles that make up the wire move up and down as a wave pulse passes through their location, but they (and the wire) do not move in the direction of the wave pulse. (We are helping you answer some questions asked earlier, but these are crucial points.) Now, some of the birds have gotten wise to your ways. Some of them will hang on no matter how tall you make the wave on the wire. You need another way to knock them off. How about causing the wire to vibrate, or oscillate, at different rates? Instead of sending down a single wave pulse, you will create a continuous wave.   Exercise 2. Oscillate the wire at different frequencies to dislodge the birds.  In this exercise, you can make the wave as tall as you want by varying the amplitude, as in Exercise 1. Now you can also alter its frequency. The number of complete cycles per second is the frequency. By complete cycles per second, we mean how many times per second you pull the wire up from equilibrium, push it down and then pull it back to its starting point. A common unit for the frequency is the hertz (Hz); one Hz equals one cycle per second.  Experiment with changing both the amplitude and the frequency at which you cause the wire to vibrate. See if you can knock all the birds off. Also use the simulation to answer the question below.   Create a wave by choosing its amplitude, in meters, and its frequency, in hertz (Hz). After assigning some values, press GO to start the wave. Observe that wave, and then change the wave by changing either its amplitude or frequency − you can do so by clicking the buttons as the simulation runs.  At any time, PAUSE freezes the wave. Press PAUSE a second time to restart the action. Press RESET if you want to start over from the beginning.  Return here to answer a follow-up question when you are done knocking the birds off the wire. Click here for the Exercise 2 Simulation  4. Make a graph of amplitude (on the vertical axis) vs. frequency (on the horizontal axis). As you increase the frequency of the wave, does the amplitude increase, decrease or does it stay the same? How can you tell this from looking at your graph?     5. Does the frequency change when you change the amplitude, or are the two properties independent of one another?     Exercise 3: Wavelength So far, you have varied the amplitude and frequency of a wave. You may have noticed that as you changed the frequency of your vibrations, the distance between the peaks of the wave also changed.  The wavelength of a wave can be measured by determining the distance between two adjacent peaks.  Figure 1. Wavelength. In general, the wavelength of a transverse wave is the distance between two adjacent points with the same displacement and at the same part of a wave cycle. For instance, the wavelength is also the distance between two points where the wave is at equilibrium but is rising. (All of this is to say: do not measure wavelength by noting adjacent points where the wave is at equilibrium, since that is one-half a wavelength. If you look at the diagram, you will see what we mean.)  Wavelength is expressed in units of length, often meters. Changing the frequency of a wave in the wire also changes the wavelength of the wave. Consider the next exercise, pictured below.   Exercise 3. Use wavelength to dislodge the birds.  Now some hummingbirds have arrived, and they have coordinated their efforts. They are sitting one meter apart, and the only way they will fly off is if you vibrate the wire so that each bird is at a peak of the wave at precisely the same moment. Each grid square in the figure shown above has a length of 0.25 meters.  Put another way, you can dislodge the birds if you vibrate the wire so the wavelength of the wave equals one meter, which is the distance between birds (there are other correct answers, but this is the simplest one).  Experiment with the frequency until you create a wave that meets these conditions − otherwise no birds will fly off. Also use the simulation to answer the question below.  Remember, GO starts the wave. PAUSE freezes the wave. (This is a particularly good exercise in which to use the PAUSE button because it permits you to see whether the peaks of the waves are reaching the hummingbirds at precisely the same instant.) Press RESET to start over.  A good way to approach this exercise is to first observe how changing the frequency affects the wavelength of the wave. Then, use the PAUSE button to see whether the wavelength needs to be longer or shorter to achieve the goal of knocking the hummingbirds off the wire. Adjust the frequency accordingly. (The wire itself stays the same as you make these changes − it does not stretch nor does its tension change. These points hold true unless we tell you otherwise.)  Note that when the red parrot changes the frequency with which it shakes the wire, it takes several seconds for the new wave to travel the length of the wire. You should wait a few seconds to see if your wave has the desired effect before trying a new wave.  You are also asked a question below which asks you to state the relationship between frequency and wavelength. After you have knocked all the birds off the wire, return here to answer some follow-up questions. Click here to go to the Exercise 3 Simulation  6. Make a graph of wavelength (on the vertical axis) vs. frequency (on the horizontal axis). As you increase the frequency of the wave, does the wavelength increase, decrease or does it stay the same? How can you tell this from looking at your graph?     7. If you double the frequency, by what factor, if any, does the wavelength change? Use the PAUSE button if necessary to take data. What happens to the wavelength if you triple the frequency?      Exercise 4: Wave speed The speed at which the wave moves along the wire is called its wave speed. To determine wave speed, you can measure how far one element of the wave − say a particular peak − moves to the right during an elapsed time. Consider the next exercise, pictured below.   Exercise 4. Calculate the speed of various waves in the wire.  Your challenge is to determine the speed of different waves traveling down the wire. You control the amplitude and frequency of the wave. The pterodactyl is perched 2.5 meters away from the red parrot, a fact that will enable you to calculate the speed of the wave in the wire.  (You cannot knock this prehistoric reptile off the wire, so you have decided to use him to collect data that will help you knock other pesky birds off later.)   When you set the amplitude and frequency and press GO, the wave will travel down the wire. The distance from the red parrot to the pterodactyl is 2.5 meters. By determining how long it takes for a wave to reach the pterodactyl, you can calculate the wave's speed.  Use the stopwatch in the control panel to determine how long it takes the wave to travel from the red parrot along the wire to the pterodactyl.  Using the PAUSE button to freeze the simulation may help you take data. Try two waves with differing amplitudes and frequencies, and enter your data in the table immediately below. In the same table, record the time it took the wave to reach the pterodactyl and calculate the wave speed. When you are done, return here for some follow-up questions about your data. Click here to enter the Exercise 4 Simulation  8.  Enter your data in the following table. You can create waves of any amplitude and frequency you choose:    AmplitudeFrequencyDistance to birdTimeSpeed  Wave 1 m Hz 2.5 m s m/s  Wave 2 m Hz 2.5 m s m/s  Wave 3 m Hz 2.5 m s m/s  Wave 4 m Hz 2.5 m s m/s    9. According to your data, does amplitude have any effect on the speed of the wave in the wire?    10. According to your data, does frequency have any effect on the speed of the wave in the wire?     Exercise 5: Frequency and wavelength You measured time and distance to determine the speed of the wave in Exercise 4. Wave speed also can be determined using two fundamental properties of a wave − its frequency and wavelength. Frequency is:  Wavelength is:  To understand the above formula for wavelength, consider a wave pulse. It starts as a peak, becomes a trough, and then returns to a peak. It completes one wave cycle in one wavelength of motion.  By multiplying frequency and wavelength, we create an equation for wave speed:  If you can determine the frequency and wavelength of a wave, you can determine the wave speed. Give it a try in the next simulation, pictured below:   Exercise 5. Use frequency and wavelength to determine the wave speed.  Now the pterodactyl is farther away. Your challenge is to determine the speed of a wave in this wire. This time, you do not have a stopwatch to measure the elapsed time.  Create a wave in the simulation and use what you know about the relationship of frequency, wavelength and wave speed to determine the speed of the wave in the wire. Repeat this exercise with another wave of a different frequency to confirm your calculations (provide another set of data).  Record the relevant data about the two waves in the table provided below. You may find it helpful to use the PAUSE button to freeze a wave so you can examine it more easily.  When you are done with the simulation, return here to answer some follow-up questions about your data. Click here to enter the Exercise 5 Simulation  11. Record data about your waves in the table below, and calculate the wave speed:   FrequencyWavelengthWave Speed  Wave 1 Hz m m/s  Wave 2 Hz m m/s    12. Compare the wave speed obtained using the frequency and wavelength method in this exercise with the wave speed obtained by timing the wave in Exercise 4. Are they the same?

These traveling disturbances − or waves − rush to each end of the string and reflect back. The reflected waves interfere with the waves that caused them.  The results of wave interference in a string explain the musical notes you hear when a guitar, harp or other stringed instrument is played. A similar form of wave interference causes the musical notes you hear in wind instruments, such as a clarinet.  This lab explores the patterns caused by wave interference in a plucked string. You will see how the properties of the string combined with the variables that describe the wave in the string dictate the sound frequency, or the pitch that you recognize as a note in a musical scale.  By the end, you can use your knowledge of wave mechanics in a string to play the opening bars of a Beethoven symphony, or to team with your classmates to play a three-part blues.   This lab focuses on the following topics: Wave frequency and pitch Wave interference Standing waves Resonance and harmonics  This lab features an extensive audio component, and is best conducted on a computer with speakers or headphones. This lab starts with a brief review of wave fundamentals: wavelength, amplitude, wave speed, and moves to wave interference, standing waves and resonance.    Exercise 1: Music and waves Plucking a string causes it to vibrate. These vibrations, which vibrate the air at the same frequency, are the source of musical notes. You can start this exploration of the role of waves in music by playing a very simple stringed instrument in the first simulation. Here, a string is stretched taut between two struts, like a string on a guitar, as shown in the picture below.   Exercise 1. Hear the relationship between string length and musical notes.  You can pluck the string and then listen to the sound created by the vibrating string. You can also observe the motion of the string, as we have slowed its motion by 100 times so you can see it.  The rightmost support (strut) holding the string is movable. You can slide it to the left, shortening the effective length of the string (as you do so, the tension of the string remains constant.) A gauge in the display will tell you what fraction the effective length is of the original length. You can create string lengths ranging from 1/4 to 15/16 of the initial length.  Try some different string lengths and listen to the musical notes created when you pluck the string. Are they different? How so? Also observe the string. Does a particle in the shorter string move up and down more times per second than one in a longer string? Is there a relationship between string length and frequency? Try alternating between the extremes in length to make this relationship most notable.  See if you can hear a relationship between frequency and the pitch of the sound created by the plucked string.  In the simulation, pressing PLAY causes a finger to pluck the string. Using headphones or your computer’s speakers, listen to the sound created by the plucked string.  Experiment by varying the length of the string. Click on the rightmost strut and slide it to the left. This shortens the length of the string. You can slide the strut back and forth to choose a variety of string lengths, and as you slide the strut, the appropriate notes will play. Use this feature to help answer the questions below.  Click here to open the Exercise 1 Simulation  1.  What happens to the pitch of the sound when the string is shortened? Do the notes sound higher or lower?    2.  What happens to the rate of oscillations in the string (the frequency) when the string is shortened?    3.  What is the relationship between vibration frequency, and the perceived pitch of the sound?     Exercise 2: Wave fundamentals: a review  Some basic concepts describe the waves that are moving in the plucked string. The amplitude, A, of a wave is the maximum displacement of the string above or below its undisturbed position. The height of a peak is the amplitude of a wave. It is stated in meters.  The frequency, f, of a wave is the number of complete, up and down cycles per second of a particle in the string. It is stated in hertz (Hz).  The wavelength, λ, is the distance between two adjacent identical points in a wave. It is measured in meters. You can measure it as the horizontal distance between two adjacent peaks or two adjacent troughs.  The wave speed, v, is the speed at which the wave travels along the string. (You were not able to see the waves traveling to and fro in the first exercise, for reasons that will be explained later.) Wave speed is related to the wave frequency and wavelength by the following equation:   Wave speed is given in meters per second. Review these properties of a wave in the following simulation. It shows a conceptual view of a wave. The wave originates at the left edge of the screen, and moves to the right. There are no boundaries (no places where the string is tied down or attached to struts), so the wave is free to move from left to right without reflecting back.   In the simulation, press GO to start the wave moving. Using the grid on the screen, measure and report the wave’s amplitude. Also measure and report the wavelength. (Pressing PAUSE to freeze the wave will assist you in making these measurements. You can press PAUSE again to resume the simulation as well.) Using the timer in the control panel, determine the frequency and the speed of the wave. You can measure its speed by noting the change in position of a peak over time. Note that the time is displayed in milliseconds, though we report speed in the usual m/s.  Using the “Time step” buttons may help you make these measurements. The time step buttons allow you to advance or rewind the wave in small increments of time.  When you are done, return here and enter your answers in the boxes below. Click here to enter the Exercise 2 Simulation  4. Report values for the following wave properties:  amplitude, A m  wavelength, λ m  frequency, f Hz  wave speed, v m/s    5.  Use your measurements for wavelength and frequency to calculate the wave speed using the equation v = fλ. Show your work. Does this value match the wave speed you measured by noting the change in position of a peak over time? (It should!)      Exercise 3: Superposition  When a string is plucked, multiple wave pulses are created that travel along the string, reflecting off the two ends where the string is attached to the struts. The beginning simulation did not show this level of detail. You now explore what happens when two waves meet at the same place on a plucked string. The waves interfere with one another, and the result of their interference can take several forms.  To determine what occurs when two waves or wave pulses meet, you apply the principle of superposition. At every point, the displacement of the combined wave can be determined by adding the displacements of the two source waves.  Observe superposition in the following simulation. Here, we show a conceptual view of two waves in a string. These are single wave pulses, one of which originates at the left edge of the screen, and the other at the right edge. The wave pulses travel in opposite directions at the same speed and will meet in the middle.  What will be the result if two positive wave pulses (i.e., two peaks) of the same height combine? What if one of the pulses is inverted into a trough (with negative displacement)? What if the two pulse amplitudes differ?   Use the simulation to answer the questions stated above. Use the amplitude controls in the control panel to set the maximum displacement of each wave pulse, then press GO to watch the wave pulses move across the screen and combine in the middle.  Try combining two positive pulses of equal amplitude, say, 1.5 m. What is the result when the wave pulses combine? In order to see the result − and measure it with the background graph − it is helpful to slow the simulation speed as the wave pulses meet. Use the time step function to advance or rewind the experiment, one frame at a time. Next, try combining a peak with an equal amplitude trough. What is the result? (We use a negative sign with the amplitude of a trough to indicate the wave displacement is below the equilibrium position. This is necessary for the simulation, but by convention, amplitude is stated as a positive value.) What happens when wave pulses of amplitude 1.5 m and −1.5 m meet?  Try different displacements, such as 2.0 m for one and 1.0 m for the other. What do you expect to see when they combine? Return here to answer a few questions when you are done. Click here to enter the Exercise 3 Simulation  6.  What is the result when two wave pulses of displacement +1.5 m meet?    7. What is the result when a wave pulse of displacement 1.5 m combines with a wave pulse of displacement −1.5 m?     8. What is the result when wave pulses of two different amplitudes combine?     Exercise 4: Reflection  When the string of a musical instrument is plucked, a wave travels down the string until it reaches the end, where the string is tied to a post or strut. Then the wave reflects off the strut and begins traveling back in the other direction.  In this simulation and the one following, we will examine in some detail what happens when a wave reflects back on itself, using a single wave pulse as the basis of our analysis.  In this simulation, a single wave pulse starts at the left edge of the screen and travels down the string to the right. On the right the string is connected to a hook attached firmly to a wall. This is a fixed point. The end of the string cannot move up or down.    Exercise 4. A wave pulse reflecting off of a fixed point.  What will happen when the wave pulse reaches the hook?  Find the answer to the question above in this simulation. There are no wave parameters to modify. You simply press GO and observe the wave pulse as it travels left to right across the screen, reflects, and moves in the opposite direction.  Observe, and answer below: When the wave pulse reflects off the hook, does it return with the same sign (orientation), or is it upside down (inverted)? In other words, does a peak return as a peak, or as a trough?  Does the reflection cause any other kind of transformation of the wave pulse? For example, does its speed change? Its amplitude? Return here to answer those questions when you are done. Click here to enter the Exercise 4 Simulation  9. Is the wave pulse reflected with the same orientation that it had originally, or is it inverted?    10. Does the reflection cause the wave pulse’s speed or amplitude to change?     Exercise 5: Reflection and standing waves You have seen how waves combine when they meet and how a single wave pulse reflects off of a fixed point. Both of these things occur when a string is plucked in a musical instrument. Waves are sent in both directions along the string, reflect off the end struts and interfere with one another after reflecting. The reflected waves then travel toward the other end, reflect again, and so on.  What is the result when these two effects are combined? Find out in this simulation. Here, you perform the basic analysis by considering what happens when a wave, a continuing series of pulses, starts on the left and reflects off the hook on the right.   In the simulation, press GO to start the wave. Allow some time for it to reflect off the hook and for the reflection to move to the left. Observe the pattern that emerges after 100 milliseconds or so using the clock in the simulation.This is about ten seconds of \"real\" time, given the \"slow motion\" used in the simulation. Describe the resulting wave by answering the questions below. Click here to enter the Exercise 5 Simulation  11. The waves you have observed in Exercises 2−4 have been traveling along the string. Does the waveform you see here seem to travel, or to stand in the same place? In other words, do the locations of peaks change over time, or stay the same?     12. When the waves you saw previously in this lab moved along the string, all the particles of the string moved up and down. Is every particle oscillating up and down in the wave that forms in this simulation after ten seconds or so? Can you find locations where the string stays stationary over time?     13. Does the final waveform have a greater amplitude, a smaller amplitude, or does it have the same amplitude as the original wave?     14.  What is the wavelength of the resulting wave? The frequency? How do these values compare to those of the initial wave?     Exercise 6: Standing waves and frequency What you observed in the prior simulation is called a standing wave, a wave that does not travel along the string. If the wave machine works in synchronization with the reflected waves to create a standing wave, we say that it is working in resonance. Its motion reinforces the waves, and the amplitude of the resulting standing wave will be greater than the amplitude of the vibrations of the wave machine. This is akin to you pushing a friend on a swing. If you time the frequency of your “pushes” correctly, you will send your friend higher.  The peaks and troughs of a standing wave stay at fixed positions on the horizontal axis. When you pluck a string, multiple waves travel up and down the string, and multiple standing waves are established in the string.  Now let’s see how this relates to the musical notes you hear when you pluck a string. You have seen that the higher the frequency of a wave in a particular plucked string, the higher the pitch of the sound produced by the vibrating string.  And you also have seen that the speed of a traveling wave in a string is related to its wavelength and frequency by the following equation:   The speed of a wave is constant in a given string with a fixed tension. Based on the equation above, if v is constant, how could you change the frequency of the wave in our plucked string in order to change the pitch of the sound you hear?  The answer is: Change the wavelength of the wave. In the simplest configuration − a string fixed at two ends − one standing wave dominates the rest. It occurs at the fundamental frequency of the string. (We will explore the other standing waves later.)  The wavelength of this dominant standing wave is determined by the length of the string. The string is fixed at two ends. When you pluck a string, one-half of a wave appears over the entire length, L, of the string. You see this half wavelength in the diagram below.     Two nodes make for half a wavelength.  If you decrease the length of the string, you also decrease the wavelength. Remembering that, we can solve this equation for λ and substitute it into the wavelength equation above to derive an equation relating frequency to the wave speed v and length L:   This is the principle at work when you move the wooden end strut of our stringed instrument to change the length of the string. Any change in the length of the string forces a change in the wavelength of the fundamental standing wave on the string. The shorter the string, the shorter the wavelength. The shorter the wavelength, the higher the frequency and the higher the pitch. The wave speed v is constant in a particular string at a set tension. This means that the length of the string and the frequency of the dominant standing wave in the string are inversely proportional.  Experiment with standing waves and frequency in this simulation.  This simulation consists of a string stretched between two struts, similar to a guitar string. The wave speed is 200 m/s in this string. You can pluck the string and then listen to the sound created by the vibrating string. You can also observe the vibration of the fundamental standing wave in the string, as we have slowed the motion of the string by 100 times so you can see it.  Without changing the string length, press PLAY to pluck the string. A standing wave is established in the string. What is its frequency? Its wavelength? Use the simulation to answer these questions, and record your answers in the spaces provided below.  The rightmost strut holding the string is movable. You can slide it to the left, shortening the effective length of the string (as you do so, the tension of the string remains constant. If the tension were to change, so would the wave speed.)  Move the strut until the length of the string is 1/2 the original length. Remember, this cuts the wavelength of the wave on the string in half as well. Before you try this, predict the frequency. Pluck the string. Is the frequency what you expected? Try some other length ratios, such as 1/3, 1/4 and so on.  Finally, if you want to create a sound of frequency 165 Hz, what would you make the length of the string? Calculate an answer and then try it in the simulation.  Return here to answer some followup questions when you are done. Click here to enter the Exercise 6 Simulation  15. Consider the string at its full length. What is its fundamental frequency? What is the wavelength of the standing wave?    16. What length of string (as a fraction of the full string length) creates a frequency of 165 Hz? Describe the steps you used to arrive at your answer.      Exercise 7: Harmonics As you saw in Exercise 6, when you pluck a string it vibrates primarily at the fundamental frequency. Imagine fixing your gaze at a single particle in the string and following it. The point you pick oscillates up and down, completing a certain number of cycles per second. If you were to pick another particle in the string, it would also oscillate up at down, at the same frequency, but likely with a different amplitude. However, there are special points along the string that bear special attention.  Nodes are points of zero displacement, places on a standing wave where the particles in the medium do not oscillate at all. The fixed endpoints of the string are examples of nodes. That is a trivial example, but we will shortly explain how other nodes can arise between the fixed endpoints. (Perhaps you remember the observations you made in Exercise 5?)  An antinode is a point of maximum displacement, where the standing wave reaches the greatest amplitude. The point at the middle of the string in the exercise above was an antinode. This is where you see the peaks and troughs.  One of the intriguing aspects of a stringed instrument is that there are other standing waves on the string at frequencies other than the fundamental one. These other standing waves also have nodes at the fixed ends of the string. In addition, they have one or more nodes positioned at regular intervals along the string.  These other standing waves, oscillating at different frequencies than the fundamental, create musical notes of a different pitch from the fundamental. This is the reason the sound created when you pluck a single guitar string is so rich. You are hearing multiple notes, as these waves are superposed on top of each other, though the sound is dominated by the fundamental frequency. A harmonic is sometimes called a resonance frequency or a natural frequency.  Given a plucked, vibrating string, you can create other standing waves by forcing a node at various positions along the string. If you touch the vibrating string gently in the middle and keep your finger there, you force a change in the shape of the string and create a node at that point, which changes the wavelength of the standing wave. The newly created standing wave has three nodes instead of two. The wavelength is now equal to the length of the string. That is, the wavelength has been cut in half by your action. Since you reduced the wavelength in half, the frequency doubles, and the new pitch is higher.  You can go further with this by placing your finger 1/3 of the way along the vibrating string, forcing a node at that position instead. This results in a standing wave with four nodes (one at each end, one that is 1/3 of the way along the string, and a matching one that is 2/3 of the way along the string), and a wavelength only one-third as long as that of the fundamental wave. The frequency of this wave is three times higher than the fundamental frequency.  These different possible standing waves on a plucked string are called harmonics. In general, a harmonic is a standing wave with a wavelength that obeys this equation:  where n = 1, 2, 3….  The frequency equation now becomes:   Experiment with harmonics in the next simulation. It again features a string stretched between two struts, similar to a guitar string. As before, you can pluck the string and listen to the sound created by the vibrating string. You can also observe the vibration of the standing wave in the string, as we have slowed the motion of the string by 100 times so you can see it.  First, press PLAY to pluck the string. A standing wave with a frequency of 66 Hz is established in the string. Next to the string you will see a second hand, with the finger pointing down. You can drag this hand to place it between the left strut to the midpoint of the string. It gently touches the vibrating string to cause nodes, and standing waves of different wavelengths. The plucking hand will continue to pluck the string as before.  Try placing the harmonic finger at the halfway point, establishing a node there. What do you think will be the dominant frequency of the vibrating string?  Try some other positions, such as 1/3 of the way from the end, 1/4, etc. Observe the relationship between the point at which the finger is placed, the new wavelength established and the new frequency.  Use the simulation to help you answer the questions below. Click here to open the Exercise 7 Simulation (optional)  17. At what fraction of the total string length would you need to place the finger to create a standing wave with five nodes (including the two at the ends)? By what factor does that increase the frequency?     18.  Using the string in this simulation, where should you place the finger to play a sound of frequency 330 Hz? Why?     Exercise 8 (optional): Playing the Physics Blues  You can use what you know about waves in plucked strings to join with your classmates and play a three-part blues. In this exercise there are three stringed instruments. The first is a guitar. It is similar to the instrument you have been playing thus far, but this one has eight strings. You can program it by changing string length or using harmonics. You can use the guitar to play the melody of a blues song we have written, or that of any song you like.  The second instrument is a piano. It has nine strings. You program the notes here the same way as the guitar’s notes. Unlike the other instruments, the piano plays multiple strings at once to form chords to accompany the melody on the guitar. You will tune the strings of the piano, and the chords will be played automatically. The third instrument is a bass, with 11 strings. Use it to play the bass line. As you may suspect, this is a good activity for teams of students. Each group can choose an instrument and program the correct notes. When each team is done, the parts can be played simultaneously, either on one computer or on three separate computers, to form a three-part blues band.  Start by setting the bass line. Here is the table of information for programming the bass:    String #Tuning methodFundamental frequencyTarget frequencyMusical note  1 Harmonic 16.5 66 C2  2 Change length 66 74.25 D2  3 Harmonics 16.5 82.5 F2  4 Change length 66 88 F2  5 Harmonic 16.5 99 G2  6 Change length 66 110 A2  7 Change length 66 118.8 Bb2  8 Change length 66 123.75 B2  9 Harmonic 16.5 132 C3  10 Harmonic 16.5 148.5 D3  11 Change length 66 158.5 Hz Eb3   Here is the table of information for programming the guitar to perform our song:    String #Tuning methodFundamental frequencyTarget frequencyMusical note  1 Change length 66 88 F2  2 Harmonic 16.5 99 G2  3 Change length 66 110 A2  4 Change length 66 118.8 Bb2  5 Harmonic 16.5 132 C3  6 Harmonic 16.5 148.5 D3  7 Change length 66 158.4 Eb3  8 Change length 66 176 F3   And here is a table of information for programming the piano:   String #Tuning methodFundamental frequencyTarget frequencyMusical note  1 Change length 33 123.75 B2  2 Harmonic 44 132 C3  3 Change length 132 148.5 D3  4 Change length 132 158.4 Eb3  5 Harmonic 33 165 E3  6 Harmonic 44 176 F3  7 Harmonic 66 198 G3  8 Change length 132 220 A3  9 Change length 132 237.6 Bb3    In this simulation, you will see tabs on the control panel marked “Bass,” “Guitar” and “Piano.” Each tab takes you to a simulation window in which you can program the notes for that instrument.  Tune each note for each instrument by changing the string length or selecting a harmonic position, as instructed in the tables above.  When you are done programming an instrument, you can press PLAY to hear the instrument play its part in the physics blues. The computer plays the notes as you have programmed them, though it takes care of the tempo and type of note (eighth note, quarter note, etc.).  If other teams have programmed instruments on their computers, press PLAY on all the computers simultaneously to hear what they sound like together. Alternatively, you can program all three instruments on one computer and then check the boxes labeled \"Bass\", \"Guitar\", and \"Piano\" to hear all three parts at once.  For a preview of what the physics blues should sound like, click below.    A frequency gauge displays the frequency of the standing waves on the strings as they are played. You can play the notes individually using your number keypad. Pressing the 1 key will play the number 1 string, the 2 key the number 2 string, and so on. To play the piano chords, press C, F, or G. These keys will play the three chords used in the composition. (If you are a pianist or guitarist, you may recognize these chords as seventh chords, major triads with a flatted seventh note.) See if these values match the values for the target frequency in the table above. If any do not, retune those strings until you play the part correctly.

Light often bends, for example, when it passes from air to water, or water to glass, or glass back to air. This is called refraction.  How light moves when it passes from one substance to another is the subject of this lab exercise. You command a fleet of helicopter gunships, firing lasers at a submarine fleet lurking below. Sometimes the submarines are in water; sometimes they are in an unidentified goop. You know where the submarines are, but can you hit them?  Use your knowledge of refraction and reflection to precisely hit the submarines − before they hit you.  This lab covers the following topics: Refraction How the speed of light changes as it moves from one substance to another The index of refraction, n Snell's Law, n1 sin θ1 = n2 sin θ2 How to calculate the speed of light in different materials Total internal reflection, and how to calculate the critical angle   Exercise 1: Refraction If someone shines a laser beam through air toward you across an unobstructed room, you might correctly guess the light follows a straight path to reach you.  But what if the light passes through something else on the way − such as water, or glass, or oil? Sometimes the passing of light from one substance to another can cause the light ray to change direction.  We will call a substance a medium (plural, media). The layer between media is called an interface. Light passes from one medium to another, crossing the interface between the media as it does so. Let's explore what happens when light passes from air to water and vice versa. Consider the simulation pictured below:   Exercise 1. Fire lasers at submarines in the water below.  In this simulation, you control the helicopters’ lasers. Fire lasers from any of the helicopters to try to hit any of the submarines lurking in the water below.  You will record no data. Just experiment with firing the lasers at different angles into the water, observe what happens and answer the question below. You aim the laser for each helicopter by clicking on the arrow and pointing it with your mouse. Once you have selected a direction for your shot, hit FIRE and watch the action. If you score a hit, you get to go again. If you miss, the computer gets a turn to fire back at you. Whoever hits all the opposing craft first − you or the computer − is the winner. You can play as many times as you want by pressing the RESET button. Use the simulation to answer the question below. Click here to open the Exercise 1 Simulation  1.  It is possible to cause the laser beam to bend dramatically when it enters or leaves the water, but you can also cause the beam to travel in a straight line at the boundary. Based on what you observed in the simulation, under what conditions does the laser beam bend the most and under what conditions does it bend very little or not at all? (If you did not notice, use the simulation to answer this question.)      Exercise 2: Speed of light Why does light often bend when it passes into the water from the air? You may have noticed in the first exercise that the laser beam travels at a different speed in the water than in the air. This speed change has something to do with making the light ray bend, and you will explore this more in the following exercise. Consider the setup pictured below:   Exercise 2. Aim lasers to hit the submarines lurking in three different media.  The goal is the same as before − to hit the submarines with laser shots before they hit you. Only now the submarines are not lurking in water, but different media. The media are labeled 1, 2, and 3 as shown in the diagram above.   In the simulation, you can only shoot at submarines confined in the same box as your helicopter. Start with any of the three helicopters, click and maneuver the aiming arrow as before, and then press FIRE when you are ready to blast away. >Observe the differences in how the light changes speed as it passes from air into each of the three different media, as well as how much the light changes direction. Output gauges will tell you the speed of the light in the three media. To consider how the relative speed of light in a medium relates to how much the light changes direction, fire the lasers so that the light strikes all three media at roughly the same angle, and consider how much it changes direction for that angle. Take note of your observations and use them to answer the series of questions below when you are done. Click here to go to the Exercise 2 Simulation  2. In which of the three media did light slow the most once it passed from the air? The least? Rank the three media in order of the observed speed of light in each, from slowest to fastest.     3. In which of the three media did light appear to bend the most as it passed from the air? The least? Rank the three media in order of how much each appeared to bend light, from most to least. Remember, as noted above, you need to do this for light that strikes the media at roughly the same angle.     4. Based on your observations, does there appear to be any relationship between the speed of light in a material and how much the light ray changes direction when it enters that material from air? Is there a direct relationship, an inverse relationship or no relationship at all? Explain your answer.      Exercise 3: Angle of refraction You saw that as light changes speed from one medium to another, it can change direction. You may also have noticed that the angle at which light strikes the interface between the two media plays a role in the bending of light. If the light is perpendicular to this interface, then the light does not bend at all, regardless of how much its speed changes. However, if the light strikes at an angle, it changes direction. In summary, light may bend when it passes from one medium to another if two conditions are met:  The speed of the light differs in the media The light strikes the interface at any angle that is not perpendicular (“normal”) to the interface  This phenomenon is called refraction.  The light ray in the first medium − in this diagram, the air − is called the incident ray. The light ray in the second medium − the water − is called the >refracted ray. The surface separating the two media is the interface. Perpendicular to the interface at the point where the ray strikes the interface is the  normal line . Normal is a mathematical term for perpendicular.   The angle of incidenceis the angle between the incident ray and the normal line. The angle between the refracted ray and the normal line is called the angle of refraction. These angles are measured relative to the normal line, not the interface. In this lab, we focus on refraction, but as the diagram shows, some of the light can reflect as well.  Let's explore these terms in the simulation pictured below:   Exercise 3. Hit the submarine and practice the terminology.  In the simulation pictured above, you will take a laser shot at a single sub, and if you miss it will shoot at you. When a hit is scored by either side, the computer will draw a full trace of the laser's path, including labeling all of the pertinent lines and the angles.  Note the specific lines and angles. Use the simulation to answer the questions below. Click here to enter the Exercise 3 Simulation  6. Once a hit was scored, the computer labeled two lines on the screen, Line 1 and Line 2. Name these two lines as they relate to refraction.     7. When a laser shot by the helicopter passed into the medium below at an incident angle other than 0 degrees (measured, as usual, from the normal), did the light bend toward the normal or away from the normal? Explain.     8. The computer also labeled two angles on the screen, Angle 1 and Angle 2. What are the names of these angles as used in the study of refraction?     9. Based on your observations of the behavior of the laser, which medium has a higher index of refraction − the medium the helicopter is in or the medium the sub is in? Explain, using what you know about the index of refraction.     Exercise 4: Snell’s law Instead of guessing where you aim your laser, would it not be better if you could calculate exactly where your light ray is going to go?  You can, with the help of a physics principle called Snell's law (named after the Dutch mathematician, Willebrord Snell, who discovered it about 400 years ago).   Snell’s law relates the indices of refraction n1 and n2 of two materials, with the angles the light forms with the normal line as it passes from one medium to the other.  Snell’s law quantifies the key principles you have experienced in this lab: that light passing from one medium to another will change direction if it changes speeds and if it crosses the interface at an angle relative to the normal other than 0°. There is a caveat here: The light can also reflect at the interface. You will experiment more with this shortly. You can see that Snell's law involves four variables: n1, n2, the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction. Remember, these angles are measured relative to the normal line, not the interface.  If you know three of these values, you can solve for the fourth. Now consider the next simulation, pictured below:   Exercise 4. Use Snell’s law to pinpoint the submarines exactly.  You control the helicopter, and you are outnumbered three to one by submarines lurking in the water. But it does not matter that you are outgunned − now you can use Snell's law to hit the submarines exactly every time.  When you click on the helicopter's aiming arrow, the angle of refraction needed to hit each of the submarines will appear on the screen, as illustrated above.  Consider this your Snell's radar. You can use this angle of refraction, along with n>1 and n2 to calculate the angle of incidence.  When you have calculated your aiming angles, simply drag the aiming arrow around until the box on the control panel reads the correct angle of incidence. Then fire away.  You must do your calculations carefully − the submarine captains have gotten much better with practice!  10. Before you open the simulation, use Snell’s law and the refraction angle values in the diagram above to calculate the predicted values for aiming angles of incidence necessary to hit each sub:  Subn of air,n1angle of incidence θ1n of water, n2angle of refraction, θ2  1 1.00 1.33 43.2°  2 1.00 1.33 36.5°  3 1.00 1.33 23.9°    Now test your answers in the simulation. Take aim at the most distant sub, Sub 1. Use the aiming arrow to adjust the angle so that it matches your calculated angle of incidence from the table directly above. Then press FIRE. If you did your calculation correctly, you will hit the sub on the first shot.  Repeat to test your other answers on the other two submarines. If you do not hit the submarines, redo your calculations and try again. You can try as many times as you like by pressing RESET. Click here to enter the Exercise 4 Simulation   Exercise 5: Total internal reflection You may have noticed in these exercises that sometimes the submarines fire a laser beam and it never leaves the water. Instead, the light ray reflects back into the water. What is going on? This is called total internal reflection, and it only occurs when light traveling in a higher index of refraction material attempts to pass into a lower index of refraction material. The light also must strike the interface with a large enough angle of incidence.  Using Snell's law, you can calculate what minimum angle of incidence will cause total internal reflection. Look at the diagram to the right. You know that when light shines up out of the water into air, a faster medium, the refracted beam bends away from the normal according to Snell's law.   There is a point at which the angle of refraction in the air − θ2 − reaches 90°. At this point, the light never leaves the water. This angle of incidence is known as the critical angle − marked in the diagram as θc.  If light strikes the interface with any incident angle greater than the critical angle, θc, then the light ray will be reflected in total back into the water.  Because we know the critical angle is defined by the case where the angle of refraction is equal to 90°, we can solve for the critical angle provided we know the refractive indices of the two materials involved. Consider Snell's law for two media. The light travels in the different media at different speeds.  where nslow is greater than nfast and the angle of refraction in the fast medium, θ2, is equal to 90 degrees (the beam is refracted along the interface line).  Setting θ2= 90°, and solving for θ1, now renamed θcritical, we find   Because sin 90° = 1, the critical angle equation is:  The critical angle is obtained by taking the arcsine:  Note that if light is passing from the fast medium into the slow medium, then it bends toward the normal. In this case, there is no total internal reflection possible.  With the critical angle equation in mind, consider the simulation pictured below:   Exercise 5. Use total internal reflection to hit the other sub.  14. What is the minimum angle of incidence at which the sub on the right must shoot its laser in order to cause total internal reflection, given that nair = 1.00 and nwater = 1.33?    Now test your answer in the simulation. As you move the aiming arrow, a readout on the control panel will show the angle of incidence relative to the normal line. If you shoot at the critical angle or at a slightly greater angle, you will hit the sub. If you do not, watch out! You can try again by hitting RESET.

A change of heat added to a system or work done by a system results in a change in the thermal energy of the system.Engines use energy to do work. Engines complete repeating cycles to do work. Engines are not 100% efficient.Heat engines are used as models of real-world engines. Heat is transferred into the engine, causing work to be done. Heat also flows out of the engine, which contributes to the engine not being 100% efficient.In an engine, the work done by the engine is equal to the net heat transfer to the engine.Heat pumps and refrigerators are examples of engines. Refrigerators force heat from a colder environment into a warmer environment. Heat pumps transfer heat from a warmer environment into a colder environment.In the first step of an engine cycle, heat flows into the system, causing the temperature and pressure of the system to increase, while the volume is constant. In the second step of an engine cycle, work is done by the system, causing the pressure and temperature of the system to decrease. Heat flows out of the system. In the third step of an engine cycle, work is done on the system, and the engine returns to its initial state.In an adiabatic process, there is no heat transfer into or out of the system. In an isobaric process, pressure remains constant. In a constant volume process, there is no work done by the system.Boyle's law shows the relationship between the pressure and volume of a gas when temperature is held constant. Charles' law shows the relationship between the volume and temperature of a gas when pressure is held constantThe ideal gas law shows the relationship between pressure, volume, amount of the gas (in moles or particles), and the temperature of the gasPressure-volume graphs describe the pressure and volume within a system during an engine cycle. The area under the graph is the amount of work done by the system.The efficiency of engine cycles can be calculated by taking ratios using either work, heat in and heat out, or temperature of the hot and cold reservoirs.The second law of thermodynamics states that engines cannot be 100% efficient.

Sound intensity can be calculated by dividing the power of a sound by the area in which it expands.Sound levels are measured in decibels and are a ratio of sound intensities.When both a sound source and listener are moving toward or away from each other, the sound frequency is different from the perspective of the source and listener.If we know the listener frequency, sound frequency, speed of source, speed of sound, and speed of listener, we can calculate what occurs when the listener moves toward or away from the sound source, when the sound source moves toward or away from the listener, or both move at the same time. Wave superposition occurs when waves are combined. In a traveling wave, the disturbance moves from one location to another.

Types of models include physical, conceptual and mathematical. Physical models describe relationships between object, conceptual models present ideas, and mathematical models use equations.Dot plots, histograms and box-and-whisker plots are tools for showing data that can be measured along a number line. Frequency is how often something occurs.Mean is the average of data, median is the number in the middle when numbers are arranged from smallest to largest, and mode is the value that occurs the most in a set of data.Normal distribution is a common pattern of data. Its graph has a symmetrical, bell-like shape.The probability of an occurrence in data that is normally distributed can be calculated.Correlation is relationship between two variables.Data that comes from linear relationships such as F = ma can be described with trend lines.Regression is a process that creates the equation that most closely matches data.The coefficient of determination supplies the measure of how well an equation matches data. 1.0 is perfect, and 0 means the equation is not a match at all.Categorical data fits into descriptions (e.g. “animal or vegetable”). It can be placed into tables.Frequencies are used to describe how often data fits descriptions. Joint frequency is how often something matches two descriptions (e.g. “girl” and “on basketball on team.”) Marginal frequency is how often data matches one description (e.g. “girl”). Relative frequency equals a joint frequency (“girl and basketball”) divided by all the data counts (e.g. the total of boys and girls).Conditional probability is the probability that an event occurs, given that one or more events have already occurred (e.g. the probability that a person is carrying an umbrella given that it is raining.)"},{"src":"25:1:1:2","type":"lessonPlan","title":"Ch 25: Tools for Physics ","sectionTitle":"Chapter 25 Overview ","sectionHeading":" Chapter 25 Overview Part ","text":"Vocabulary: models − physical, conceptual and mathematical.,STEM Skills:Review models students have encountered (e.g. Newton’s,Language Arts Connection: Encourage students to continue recording their thoughts, questions, and vocabulary definitions and sentences in their Science Notebooks.
