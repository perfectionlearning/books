	In this lab, you will use the theoretical relationship between the length of a simple pendulum and its period of oscillation. By making a simple pendulum and measuring its period, you can determine the acceleration due to gravity.

	<b>General Lab Safety:</b>
	</br></br>
	Observe all procedures detailed by your instructor.
	</br></br>
	Keep a clean and orderly work space.

	A mass on the end of a string is an example of a simple pendulum. If the mass is displaced from the vertical equilibrium position and then released, it will execute simple harmonic motion (approximately) with a period T of

	where L is the length of the pendulum, and g is the acceleration due to gravity.
	</br></br>
	A detailed analysis will show that the period actually increases very slightly as the amplitude increases. Fortunately, if the amplitude is kept to a few degrees, the formula above is accurate to better than 0.1%. You don't have to measure the amplitude accurately: just keep the amplitude fairly small.

	</br></br>
	Given what you know about the relationship of period, pendulum length and g, how can you use a pendulum to measure g? Try to design your experiment before you read onward. 
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Question</div>
	</br>
	Re-arrange the equation above to show that the square of the period is proportional to the length of the pendulum. What is the constant of proportionality?

		1.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Create a chart with the following columns
		</br></br>
		<ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left: 40px;font:16px arial">
			<li>Column 1: Length of the pendulum (m) </li></br>
			<li>Column 2: Period of oscillation (s) </li></br>
		</ul>
		2.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Attach the top end of the string to the pendulum support.
		</br></br>
		3.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Attach the smallest mass to the lower end of the string, and adjust the support so that L is about a meter.
		</br></br>
		4.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Carefully measure L from the top of the string to the center of the mass.
		</br></br>
		5.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Start the pendulum swinging with a small amplitude, and measure the period by timing 10 full oscillations with a stopwatch (don’t forget to divide the total time by 10). 
		</br></br>
		6.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Repeat the previous 2 steps for five more values of L, down to about half a meter.
		</br></br>
		7.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Make a graph of T<sup>2</sup> (vertical axis) vs. L (horizontal axis). Determine the slope of your best line through the data. This slope should correspond to 4π<sup>2</sup>/g. From your slope, solve for g. Calculate the percentage error relative to the accepted value of 9.80 m/s<sup>2</sup>.

	A hypothesis is a brief statement that describes what you expect your experiment to show.

	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Uncertainty in measured data</div></br>
	For a single value of L, have one lab partner measure T with a stopwatch, for one back and forth swing of the pendulum. Then have the other lab partners do the same thing. Is there a relatively large “spread” in the results? To quantify the “spread”, calculate the standard deviation of the different measurements.
	</br></br>
	Identify the causes of the uncertainty in your measured data. What are some reasons that the lab partners got different results? Didn’t you all measure the same thing?
	</br></br>
	Identify the effects of the uncertainty in your measured data. If you use the lowest value of T in the equation that relates T, L, and g, what value of g do you obtain? What happens if you use the highest value of T that your group measured?
	</br></br>
	Quantify the causes of the uncertainty in your measured data. How confident are you in the result of the experiment of measuring the time for one back and forth swing? Are you sure that your result is accurate to within, say, 1 second? How about 0.5 seconds? (Hint: you may want to do some experiments regarding human reaction time.)
	</br></br>
	For the same value of L, now have one lab partner measure T with a stopwatch, for 10 back and forth swings of the pendulum (and then dividing the total time by 10). Then have the other lab partners do the same thing. Is there a smaller “spread” in the results? To quantify the “spread”, calculate the standard deviation of the different measurements.
	</br></br>
	Now that you each have measured T using 10 complete swings, if you use the lowest value of T in the equation that relates T, L, and g, what value of g do you obtain? What happens if you use the highest value of T that your group measured? What are the advantages and disadvantages of making measurements of 10 periods vs. making just one.
	</br></br>
	Can you design a new experiment to measure T that can eliminate or reduce some of the uncertainties that you have encountered?
