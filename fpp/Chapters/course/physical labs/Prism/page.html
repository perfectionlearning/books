	Isaac Newton is perhaps best known for his celebrated laws of motion, but he also made important contributions to the field of optics. In particular, he was first to explain the reason behind rainbows. Roger Bacon, a philosopher from the 13th century, guessed that the colors of a rainbow are due to the reflection and refraction of sunlight through raindrops, and Newton’s work later confirmed this hypothesis.
	</br></br>
	We now know that the wavelength of a visible electromagnetic wave determines the color that we perceive, but in Newton’s time, scientists believed that white light was colorless, and that the process of passing white light through a glass prism produced the color.
	</br></br>
	Newton's experiments showed that all the colors already existed in the white light, and that "corpuscles" (particles) of light were spread out by the prism because particles with different colors traveled at different speeds through the glass.
	</br></br>
	In this lab, you will reproduce Newton’s experiments and refract white light with a prism, resolving it into its component colors: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo and Violet. A mnemonic for the order is our friend, Roy G. Biv.

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Safety</div>
	Do not look directly into the light source, especially if it is the sun, or cause the beam to be directed or reflected into anyone’s eyes!
	</br></br>
	The only safe way to view the beam or any of its reflections is to have it strike a diffuse reflector, such as a card.
	</br></br>
	Remove watches and reflective jewelry.
	</br></br>
	<b>General Lab Safety:</b>
	</br></br>
	Observe all procedures detailed by your instructor.
	</br></br>
	Keep a clean and orderly work space.
	</br></br>
	If you break or spill something, notify your instructor immediately.
	</br></br>
	If someone needs first aid, notify your instructor immediately.
	</br></br>
	When you have completed an experiment, always dispose of, recycle or store equipment and supplies in their proper location.
	</br></br>
	If in doubt: Ask!

	</br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Discussion:</br></div></br>
	Humans perceive different wavelengths of light as different colors. When we see light of a single wavelength, we perceive it as a pure color, such as red, green or violet. The light that comes from the Sun and from incandescent light bulbs, which we see as white light, is actually a mixture of many different wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation.
	</br></br>
	Prisms separate white light into its component wavelengths. Prisms disperse light because the index of refraction depends on the light’s wavelength, so the speed of light waves differs depending on the light’s color. This is called dispersion, or to be more specific, chromatic dispersion, since dispersion can also occur with non-visible electromagnetic radiation and mechanical waves as well.

	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;"></br>Question</br></div></br>
	When white light hits a prism, the different wavelengths are refracted at different angles, resulting in a rainbow of colors. Look at how the colors of light are ordered on the other side of the prism. Do you think that blue light is bent (“refracted”) more when it enters the glass from air, or do you think that red light is bent more? If light of a certain color bends more, then glass has a relatively large index of refraction for that color.
