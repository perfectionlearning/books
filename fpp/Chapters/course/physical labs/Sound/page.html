<!-- <div class="pActivityHeader">Sound</div> -->
<div class="pLabPageIntro">
	Acoustic (sound) resonance can be used to determine the wavelength of a sound wave. Tuning forks are labeled with the frequency they generate. Using resonance and a tuning fork, you can determine both the frequency and wavelength of a sound wave.
	</br></br>
	Since wave speed is the product of frequency and wavelength, you can determine the speed of sound in air.
	</br></br>
	Resonance tubes can be as simple as a plastic tube being dipped into water in a graduated cylinder, or as complicated as a dedicated expanding cardboard tube from a physics equipment supplier. We will describe the experimental procedure using the former method, but if you have a resonance tube, the procedure is very similar.
	</br></br>
	Sound is a wave. As your textbook discusses, reflecting waves interfere. If they interfere constructively, they get louder. An acoustic wave will constructively interfere with a closed air column at specific fractions of its wavelength, namely at 1/4, 3/4, and 5/4, etc. of its wavelength. When the air column’s length equals these fractions of the sound’s wavelength, the sound produced by a tuning fork held above such an air column will become louder.

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Design an Experiment</div>
	</br>
	How can you use the PVC pipe and the tall cylinder of water to create air columns of different heights? Try to design this part of your experiment before you read onward.
	</br></br>
	By vibrating a tuning fork above a column of air whose height is variable, you can search for resonances, when the sound suddenly gets louder. This will allow you to determine the wavelength of the sound wave.
	</br></br>
	Given what you know about the relationship of wavelength, frequency, and wave speed, how can you calculate the speed of sound in air?
	</br></br>
	Try to complete the design of your experiment before you read onward.
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 14px arial;">Identify the Variables</div></br>
	What are all the variables that you will have to measure in order to find the speed of sound in air? Explain. What letters will you use to represent each of these physical quantities?
	</br></br>
	Is there other information or equipment that you will need to make a more accurate measurement? Explain, referring to diagrams if necessary. 
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 14px arial;">Steps in the Experiment</div></br>
	<div class="pLabQASection">
		1.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Partially fill a graduated cylinder with water. You do not want it to overflow when the PVC pipe is placed in it.
		</br></br>
		2.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Place the PVC pipe into the graduated cylinder. Note the height of the air column above the water. Begin with the PVC pipe almost all the way down, so as to have a short air column (about 10 cm). 
		</br></br>
		3.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Use a tuning fork with a known frequency.
		</br></br>
		4.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Strike the tuning fork. Place it above the PVC pipe so that the tines vibrate vertically, parallel to the axis of the pipe. 
		</br></br>
		5.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Raise the pipe and the tuning fork together until the sound clearly becomes louder. This is the fundamental node, or the first harmonic. At this point, the length of the air column is 1/4 the wavelength. (Note: It should be on the order of 20 to 30 centimeters). 
		</br></br>
		6.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Measure this length in meters.
		</br></br>
		7.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Keep raising the pipe and fork so there is a taller column of air between its top and the water in the cylinder. When the sound again becomes louder, you have found the second harmonic. At this point, the length of the air column is 3/4 the wavelength.
		</br></br>
		8.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Keep raising the pipe and fork so there is a taller column of air between its top and the water in the cylinder. When the sound again becomes louder, you have found the third harmonic. At this point, the length of the air column is 5/4 the wavelength. 
		</br></br>
		9.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Fill in the table below. Multiply the length of the air column by the appropriate fraction to calculate the wavelength of the sound wave for different harmonics. 
		</br></br>
		10.&nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you have multiple tuning forks, complete the table for 2 or 3 frequencies. For a fixed frequency, all of the wavelength measurements should be the same.

	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 14px arial;">Question 1</div></br>
	Will the product of frequency and wavelength for a sound wave be constant? Explain.
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 14px arial;">Hypothesis</div></br>
	A hypothesis is a brief statement that describes what you expect your experiment to show.
	</br></br>
	State your hypothesis for the question above.
	</br></br>
	To check your answer, add a column to your table showing the product of frequency and wavelength for each of your trials. What is your determination of the speed of sound in air? 
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 14px arial;">Question 2</div></br>
	What might be some sources of error in the lab (comparing your measured speed of sound to the standard value for the speed of sound, as reported in the textbook)? 
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 14px arial;">Analyze Your Results</div></br>
	<div class="pLabQASection"><div style= " font:bold 14px arial;">Is Your Data Reasonable?</div></div></br></br>
	In order to determine if your data is reasonable, consider the following questions:</br></br></br></br>
	1.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You may know the old rule of thumb to determine how far away a lightning flash is: Watch the sky for a flash of lightning, count the number of seconds until you hear thunder, and divide the number of seconds by 3 to calculate the distance in kilometers. Is your value for the speed of sound roughly consistent with this rule of thumb? 
	</br></br>
	2.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If you have calculated any values, are those values reasonable based on the data used for the calculation?
	</br></br>
	3.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Are you getting the same general results as other lab groups are getting?
	</br></br>
	4.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If the answer to any question above is “no,” it does NOT mean your lab results are wrong. But you may want to try to retake some measurements, for example, remeasuring the current through a resistor, to see if you get the same results as before.
	</br></br>
	<div class="pLabQASection"><div style= " font:bold 14px arial;">Determine Sources of Uncertainty</div></div></br>
	
	5.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In every experiment there are potential sources of error, and/or instances of a lack of accuracy and precision. Explain what sources of error or lack of accuracy and precision might be in this lab.
	</br></br></br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 14px arial;">Form Your Conclusion</div></br>
	
	<div class="pLabQASection"><div style= " font:bold 14px arial;">Think Critically</div></div></br>
	</br>
	6.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If your experiment proved your hypothesis, your conclusion is merely a restatement of your hypothesis.
	</br></br>
	7.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If your experiment did not prove your hypothesis, you may have to design another experiment and form a new hypothesis based on your experimental data.
