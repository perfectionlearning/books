	Waves can be either longitudinal or transverse, where the oscillations occur either parallel or perpendicular to the direction of wave motion, respectively. Light waves are transverse; the electric and magnetic fields oscillate perpendicular to the direction of light propagation.
	</br></br>
	In order to explain linear polarization, let’s consider another transverse wave: a mechanical wave on a long rope. Tie one end to a tree, stretch the rope taut, and shake the other end wildly and randomly. The rope particles will oscillate in all directions that are perpendicular to the wave motion. This is an unpolarized wave.
	</br></br>
	Now suppose the rope passes through a white picket fence. On the other side of the fence, the rope oscillates up and down only, in a vertical plane. (One could say that the fence had a vertical transmission axis.) When the vibration of a transverse wave lies in a plane at a fixed orientation in space, the wave is said to be linearly polarized.

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Safety</div>
	Do not look directly into the laser beam or cause the beam to be directed or reflected into anyone’s eyes!
	</br></br>
	The only safe way to view the beam or any of its reflections is to have it strike a diffuse reflector, such as a card.
	</br></br>
	Keep the beam parallel to the table top and be aware of the direct and reflected beams.
	</br></br>
	Remove watches and reflective jewelry.
	</br></br>
	<b>General Lab Safety:</b>
	</br></br>
	Observe all procedures detailed by your instructor.
	</br></br>
	Keep a clean and orderly work space.
	</br></br>
	If you break or spill something, notify your instructor immediately.
	</br></br>
	If someone needs first aid, notify your instructor immediately.
	</br></br>
	When you have completed an experiment, always dispose of, recycle or store equipment and supplies in their proper location.
	</br></br>
	If in doubt: Ask!

	</br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Discussion:</br></div>
	Light that passes through a linear polarizer is <i>linearly polarized</i>, parallel to the transmission axis.
	</br></br>
	For <i>unpolarized</i> incident light, the intensity of the polarized light that emerges is one-half of what it was initially. The linear polarizer extinguishes all components of the electric field that are perpendicular to the transmission axis, so it makes sense that the light is dimmer. 
	</br></br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Question 1</br></div>
	</br></br>
	If you place a linear polarizer in front of unpolarized light, it is half as intense on the other side. What do you think will happen to the brightness if the linear polarizer is rotated? Will the intensity change?
	</br></br>

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle"></br>Intensity of Polarized Light After Further Polarization</div>
	</br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Discussion:</br></div>
	For polarized incident light, the intensity of the polarized light that emerges depends on the angle between the initial direction of polarization and the polarizer’s transmission axis.
	</br></br>
	If the relative angle is θ, only the component parallel to the transmission axis will be transmitted. Thus, E<sub>T</sub> = E<sub>0</sub> cosθ, where E<sub>T</sub> is the transmitted electric field and E<sub>0</sub> is the incident electric field.
	</br></br>
	The intensity of light is proportional to the square of the electric field. Therefore, the intensity of the transmitted light is related to the intensity of the incoming polarized light by the following equation:
	</br></br>
	<i>I</i><sub>T</sub>= <i>I</i><sub>0</sub> cos<sup>2</sup>θ
	</br></br>
	This is the Law of Malus.
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Question 2</br></div>
	</br>
	If initially unpolarized light passes through one polarizer, and then a second one whose transmission axis is <i>parallel</i> to that of the first one, what will be the final intensity of the light?
