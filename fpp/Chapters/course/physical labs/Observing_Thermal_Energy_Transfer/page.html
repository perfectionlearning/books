<!-- <div class="pActivityHeader">Observing_Thermal_Energy_Transfer</div> -->
<div class="pLabPageIntro">
	Conduction, Convection, and Radiation are three ways that thermal energy is transferred. You will use your powers of observation and perform a few experiments to determine how thermal energy moves through various states of matter. You can demonstrate each form of this energy transfer through solids, gases and liquids (except for convection, which does not occur within solids).

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Safety</div>
	</br>
	<b>Thermal Energy Safety:</b>
	</br></br>
	Do not touch heated surfaces without proper protection, such as insulated gloves.
	</br></br>
	Let hot liquids, solids, or gases cool down before transferring them or cleaning them up.

	</br></br>
	<b>General Lab Safety:</b>
	Observe all procedures detailed by your instructor.
	</br></br>
	Keep a clean and orderly work space.
	</br></br>
	If you break something or spill something, notify your instructor immediately.
	</br></br>
	If someone needs first aid, notify your instructor immediately.
	</br></br>
	When you have completed an experiment, always dispose of, recycle, or store equipment and supplies in their proper location.

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Exercise 1: Observing the Transfer of Thermal Energy</div>
	</br>
	In Exercise 1, we want you to consider the transfer of thermal energy using a variety of materials in your classroom.
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Question</div>
	</br>
	Which methods of thermal energy transfer can be observed in solids, liquids, and gases?
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Hypothesis</div></br>
	</br>
	A hypothesis is a brief statement that describes what you expect your experiment to show. For example, in this question you have to decide whether thermal energy is transferred by conduction, convection, or radiation to solids, liquids, and/or gases. 
	</br></br>	
	State your hypothesis for the question above.
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Design of the Experiment</div></br>
	
	In this experiment you will observe a variety of materials to determine if thermal energy has been transferred.
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Identify the Variables</div></br>
	Thermal energy, temperature, various objects and/or substances
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Steps in the Experiment</div></br>
	<div class="pLabQASection">
	Create a Data Collection Chart</br></br>
		1.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Column 1: Name of object or substance observed
		</br></br>
		2.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Column 2: Observation location (for example, a sunny window)
		</br></br>
		3.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Column 3: Was thermal energy transferred? Yes/No
		</br></br>	
		4.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Columns 4-6: Labeled Convection, Conduction, and Radiation, respectively
		</br></br>
	Conduct Your Observations</br></br>
		5.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As you follow the steps below, note in your Data Collection chart whether or not thermal energy was transferred and the method by which you think the energy was transferred. 
		</br></br>
		6.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Place the following in the sunlight:
		</br></br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp a. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Wooden craft stick
		</br></br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp b. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Glass rod
		</br></br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp c. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Black construction paper
		</br></br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp d. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Piece of aluminum foil
		</br></br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp e. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Small balloon filled with air (Don’t forget to anchor this in position; you might tie a string onto the knotted end of the balloon and either use a weight at the other end of the string or tie it in place.)
		</br></br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp f. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Petri dish with water
		</br></br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp g. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Petri dish with water placed on top of black construction paper
		</br></br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp h. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Petri dish with water placed on top of a piece of aluminum foil
		</br></br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp i. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Using the thermometer, measure the temperature of the air closest to the sunlit window and compare it to the air temperature in the rest of the classroom.
		</br></br>
		7.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Place the same items from step 6 away from the sunlit window and in front of a fan.
		</br></br>
		8.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Place the following in a dishpan of very warm water:
		</br></br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp a. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Wooden craft stick
		</br></br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp b. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Glass rod
		</br></br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp c. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Metal spoon

		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp e.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Air-filled balloon
		</br></br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp f.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Beaker with ice
		</br></br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp g.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Beaker with water
		</br></br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp h.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Using the thermometer, measure the temperature of the air closest to the container of very warm water and compare it to the air temperature in the rest of the classroom. 
		</br></br>
		9.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Put on safety goggles. Then place the following on a hot plate and turn on the heat to medium. As another option, use a ring stand, ring clamps, clamps, and 90-degree rod clamps to hold a 4-inch ring and a ring stand screen over a Bunsen burner. Place the beakers on the ring stand screen for several minutes. 
		</br></br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp a.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Beaker of tap water
		</br></br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp b.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Beaker of ice
		</br></br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp c.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Using a thermometer, measure the temperature of the contents before and after the thermal energy is added to the beaker of tap water, and to the beaker of ice.
		</br></br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp d.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When you have completed your observations, turn off the heat and allow the containers to cool. Remove using a thermal glove and place on a heat resistant surface or hot pad until completely cool. 
		</br></br>
		10.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Place the following in a microwave oven in a microwave safe container for 20 to 30 seconds:
		</br></br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp a.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp water
		</br></br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp b.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ice
		</br></br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp c.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Using a thermometer, measure the temperature of the contents before and after the thermal energy is added to the beaker of tap water, and to the beaker of ice. 
		</br></br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp d.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When you have completed your observations, remove the items using a thermal glove and place on a heat resistant surface or hot pad until completely cool.
		</br></br>
		11.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Clean up all items used and store them according to your instructor’s directions.
