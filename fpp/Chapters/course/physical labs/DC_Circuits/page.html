<!-- <div class="pActivityHeader">DC Circuits</div> -->
<div class="pLabPageIntro">
	There are three types of DC circuits: series, parallel, and series-parallel (also known as mixed). In this lab you will build series and parallel circuits, and explore some of the characteristics of these circuits and their components using a multimeter, Ohm’s law, and Kirchhoff’s rules.
	</br></br>
	The lab includes the use of batteries. Some batteries can be re-charged. Do not dispose of these! If they are not of this type, make sure you dispose of them properly. Try to minimize battery use to prolong their life.

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Safety</div>
	Be sure your hands and clothing are dry before handling any electrical components.
	</br></br>
	Check electrical equipment to ensure that there are no frayed wires. If you find a frayed wire or other damage to an electrical cord, notify your instructor immediately. DO NOT use the equipment.
	</br></br>
	Do not touch both terminals of a battery at the same time.
	</br></br>
	Handle wire by keeping your hands on the insulated portion of the wire.
	</br></br>
	Use insulated tools to connect wires and electrical components in a circuit.
	</br></br>
	Remember, even low voltage can cause injury.
	</br></br>
	<b>General Lab Safety:</b>
	</br></br>
	Observe all procedures detailed by your instructor.
	</br></br>
	Keep a clean and orderly work space.
	</br></br>
	If you break or spill something, notify your instructor immediately.
	</br></br>
	If someone needs first aid, notify your instructor immediately.
	</br></br>
	When you have completed an experiment, always dispose of, recycle, or store equipment and supplies in their proper locations.
	</br></br>
	If in doubt: Ask!

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Exercise 1: Design, Build, and Analyze a Series Circuit</div>
	</br>
	In exercise 1, we want you to consider the current running through components connected in series in a DC circuit.
	</br></br>
	Series wiring is circuit wiring in which the components are placed one after another.
	</br></br>
	Here, you will consider the relationship of current, potential difference, and power for components (e.g., different resistances) connected in series.
	</br></br>
	Draw a picture in your lab notebook of a battery in series with a switch, in series with a “resistor 1”, in series with a “resistor 2”. 
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Hypothesis</div></br>
	Form hypotheses to answer the questions that are asked. For example: “Electric current is the same in components when they are in series.” If you are not ready to form a hypothesis, make some observations, form a hypothesis, and then test it with later observations.
	</br></br>
	State your hypothesis for the question above.
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Questions</div></br>
	The following questions should guide your experimental design.
	</br></br>
	Does the same amount of current flow through components connected in series? Or could it be a function of the resistance of the component(s)? Explain.
	</br></br>
	How would you design an experiment to test your hypothesis? What equipment will you need? Explain, referring to diagrams if necessary.
	</br></br>
	Is the potential difference measured across each of the components going to be the same when they are connected in series? Or could it be a function of the resistance of the component(s)? Explain.
	</br></br>
	How would you design an experiment to test your hypothesis? What equipment will you need? Explain, referring to diagrams if necessary.
	</br></br>
	Is the power consumption the same for each of the components connected in series? (Power equals the product of current and voltage.) Or could it be a function of the resistance of the component(s)? Explain.
	</br></br>
	How would you design an experiment to test your hypothesis? What equipment will you need? Explain, referring to diagrams if necessary.
	</br></br>
	Consider the total power consumed by all the components. Considering the law of conservation of energy, how do you think this will compare to the total power supplied by the battery?
	</br></br>
	How would you design an experiment to test your hypothesis? What equipment will you need? Explain, referring to diagrams if necessary.
	</br></br>
	How is the resistance of each of the components related to the overall, equivalent resistance of the series combination? Explain.
	</br></br>
	How would you design an experiment to test your hypothesis? What equipment will you need? Explain, referring to diagrams if necessary. 
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Identify the Variables</div></br>
	What are all the variables that you will have to measure in order to answer your questions? Explain. What letters will you use to represent each of these physical quantities? 
	</br></br></br>
	Hint: Use subscripts to identify components, such as V<sub>R1</sub> for the voltage across the first resistor.
