	Mirrors reflect light. They can create real or virtual images.
	</br></br>
	This is a brief lab. We suggest that you perform these experiments along with the lab on thin lenses.

	</br>Mirrors can break, and the glass pieces will be sharp. Also, who needs seven years of bad luck?
	</br></br>
	<b>General Lab Safety:</b>
	</br></br>
	Observe all procedures detailed by your instructor.
	</br></br>
	Keep a clean and orderly work space.
	</br></br>
	If you break or spill something, notify your instructor immediately.
	</br></br>
	If someone needs first aid, notify your instructor immediately.
	</br></br>
	When you have completed an experiment, always dispose of, recycle or store equipment and supplies in their proper location.
	</br></br>
	If in doubt: Ask!

	A virtual image is on the opposite side of the mirror than the object it is created from. It cannot be projected onto a piece of paper at its perceived location A real image is on the same side as the object that creates it and can be projected onto a piece of paper.

	A plane mirror is a flat mirror.

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle"></br>Steps in Experiment 2: How tall should a full length mirror be?</div>
	</br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Discussion:</br></br></div>
	You want to determine how tall a mirror must be so that you can see both the top of your head (including a hat if possible) and your toes. 
	</br></br>
	<div class="pLabQASection">
		4.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Stand in front of a full-length plane mirror. (A field trip to a mall will work if you do not have one in your school. Please ask permission of the store manager to do a short experiment.) 
		</br></br>
		5.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Start with your toes. Have a classmate raise the ruler until it reaches the height on the mirror at which you see your toes. In other words, the student raises the ruler from the bottom of the mirror until it reaches the height at which it will block your view of your own toes. Mark this point with masking tape.
		</br></br>
		6.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Repeat this, starting at the top, finding the location at which the ruler will block your view of the top of your head (or hat). Mark this location with masking tape.
		</br></br>
		7.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Measure the distance between the masking tape positions.
		</br></br>
		8.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Remove the tape.
		</br></br>
		9.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp How does the distance you measured compare to your total height?
		</br></br>
		10.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Can you explain this with a ray tracing diagram? Hint: The angle of reflection must equal the angle of incidence. Draw a ray from your eyes to the mirror to your toes. Consider congruent triangles. Then repeat this process for a ray from your eyes to the mirror up to the top of your head.
