<div class="pLabPageIntro">
	Electrostatics is the study of charges at rest (static) as opposed to moving (in a current). Here, you study how charged objects attract and repel.

	<b>General Lab Safety:</b>
	</br></br>
	Observe all procedures detailed by your instructor.
	</br></br>
	Keep a clean and orderly work space.
	</br></br>
	If you break or spill something, notify your instructor immediately.
	</br></br>
	If someone needs first aid, notify your instructor immediately.
	</br></br>
	When you have completed an experiment, always dispose of, recycle or store equipment and supplies in their proper location.

	Like charges attract and opposite charges repel. By rubbing an object such as a glass rod with another material, you can charge each of the objects. Electrons are added or removed from the rod, leaving it with either a negative or a positive charge, respectively.

	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Discussion:</br></div></br></br>
	An electroscope can be used to detect nearby electrically charged objects. We will assume that the charged object is a rod and that we have a gold-leaf electroscope. To use it, bring the rod near the ball at the top of the electroscope. The rod induces a charge in the leaves, either by repelling electrons from the ball into the leaves (if the rod is negatively charged) or by attracting electrons out of the leaves toward the ball (if the rod is positively charged). No contact is required. 
	</br></br>
	The amount the leaves separate will increase with the strength and closeness of the rod.
	</br></br>
	The electroscope cannot tell you if the rod is positively or negatively charged—only if it is charged.
