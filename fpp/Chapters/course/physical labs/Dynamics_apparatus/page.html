<div class="pLabPageIntro">
	Newton’s Second Law of Motion develops the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration. In this experiment you will use a dynamics apparatus to explore this relationship for yourself by using a variety of simple, everyday objects. You will be recording your observations, taking measurements, and using mathematics to develop the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration.

	</br>
	In this experiment, you will consider the relationship of force, mass, and acceleration when the mass is held constant.
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Question</div></br>
	</br>
	If different amounts of force are applied to an object of constant mass, will the acceleration be affected?

	</br>
	State your hypothesis for the question above.
	</br></br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Design of the Experiment</div></br>
	</br>
	In this experiment you will place a flatbed vehicle on a level surface. You will vary the force pulling on the vehicle while keeping the mass constant. You will measure the acceleration of the vehicle.
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Identify the Variables</div></br>
	Use “F” for force, “m” for mass, “d” for distance, and “t” for time.
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Steps in the Experiment</div></br></br>
	<div class="pLabQASection">
	Prepare a Data Collection Chart</br></br>
		1.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Create a Data Collection Chart to record the following for each of three trials
		</br></br>
		&nbsp &nbsp a.&nbsp &nbsp Mass of the vehicle (constant)
		</br></br>		
		&nbsp &nbsp	b.&nbsp &nbsp Total mass of slotted masses
		</br></br>			
		&nbsp &nbsp	c.&nbsp &nbsp Total mass of vehicle and slotted masses
		</br></br>
		&nbsp &nbsp	d.&nbsp &nbsp Force exerted by spring scale
		</br></br>
		&nbsp &nbsp	e.&nbsp &nbsp Acceleration of vehicle across the plank
		</br></br>
		&nbsp &nbsp	f.&nbsp &nbsp Observations
		</br></br>
	Set Up Apparatus</br></br>
		2.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Place the plank on a table or desk and let one end hang slightly over the edge.
		</br></br>
		<div style="display: inline-block;float: left;">3.</div><div style="display: flex;display: -webkit-flex;padding-left: 23px;">Use the level to help you make minor adjustments to ensure the plank is level. For example, you may have to insert a thin piece of cardboard at one end.</div>
		</br></br>	
		4.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Mount the motion sensor on the end of the plank away from the pulley.
		</br></br>
		5.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to set up all hardware and software that accompanies the motion sensor.
		</br></br>
		6.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You will use the manufacturer’s data collection software to collect and analyze your data.
		</br></br>
		7.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Set up the software to collect velocity vs. time.
		</br></br>
		<div style="display: inline-block;float: left;">8.</div><div style="display: flex;display: -webkit-flex;padding-left: 23px;">Place the block of wood in front of the pulley and secure it from the side of the plank with a C-clamp. (This block of wood will stop your vehicle and mark the end of the distance traveled.)</div>
		</br></br>
		9.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Place the vehicle on the plank.
		</br></br>
		10.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Extend the length of string over the top of the pulley.
		</br></br>
		11.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp To the end of the string opposite the vehicle, tie a spring scale.
		</br></br>
		12.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Suspend the mass hanger from the spring scale.
		</br></br>
	Vary the Force</br></br>
		</br></br>
		13.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Set the vehicle at the end of the plank opposite the pulley.
		</br></br>
		14.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hold the vehicle in position while your partner adds a slotted mass to the mass hanger.
		</br></br>
		15.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Record the value of the weight used as well as the force indicated by the spring scale in your Data Collection Chart.
		</br></br>
		16.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Coordinate when you will let go of the vehicle so that your partner can signal the software to start recording data.
		</br></br>
		17.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Repeat steps 13−16 for three different slotted masses or combinations of slotted masses.

	<div class="pLabQASection"><div style= "font:bold 16px arial;">Calculate and Graph Your Results</div></div></br></br></br>
	1.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp For each of your data runs, make a graph of velocity vs. time and do a straight line fit. Find the slope of the line.
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Question</div></br>
	</br>
	Why should this be a straight line? What is the interpretation of the slope?
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Hypothesis</div></br>
	A hypothesis is a brief statement that describes what you expect your experiment to show.
	</br></br>
	State your hypothesis for the question above.
	</br></br>
	2.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Create a summary graph for the experiment that illustrates the relationship of force to acceleration.
	</br></br>
	<div class="pLabQASection"><div style= " font:bold 16px arial;">Compare and Contrast</div></div></br>
	3.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Describe the relationship of mass, force, and acceleration based on the graph you created.
	</br></br>
	4.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What modification to the experimental procedure would you recommend to be sure the results were more consistent?
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Evaluate Your Data</div></br>
	<div class="pLabQASection"><div style= " font:bold 16px arial;">Is Your Data Reasonable?</div></div></br>
	In order to determine if your data is reasonable, consider the following questions:</br></br></br></br>
	1.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Are the calculated values reasonable based on the data used for the calculation?
	</br></br>
	2.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If you know a formula that relates the values you measured, does your data match those values?
	</br></br>
	3.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Are you getting the same general results as other lab groups?
	</br></br>
	4.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If the answer to any question above is “no,” it does NOT mean your lab results are wrong. But you may want to try to re-create the same experiment, for example, run another series of trials, to see if you get the same results. This may get rid of mistakes, such as mistakes in measurement or in recording values.
	</br></br>
	<div class="pLabQASection"><div style= "font:bold 16px arial;">Determine Sources of Uncertainty</div></div></br>
	</br>
	5.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In every experiment there are potential sources of error and/or instances of a lack of accuracy and precision. Explain what sources of error and lack of accuracy and precision might be in this experiment.

	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Form Your Conclusion</div></br>
	</br>
	<div class="pLabQASection"><div style= " font:bold 16px arial;">Think Critically</div></div></br>
	</br>
	1.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If your experiments proved your hypotheses, your conclusion is merely a restatement of your hypotheses.
	</br></br>
	<div style="display: inline-block;float: left;">2.</div><div style="display: flex;display: -webkit-flex;padding-left: 23px;">If your experiments did not prove your hypotheses, you may have to design additional experiments and form new hypotheses based on your new experimental data. If this is the case, ask your instructor if there is time to redesign and re-run one or more of your experiments.
	</br></br></div>
	3.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What scientific laws or theories have you studied that support your experiences in these experiments?
	</br></br>
	4.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Create a summary statement that relates force, mass, and acceleration.
	</br></br>
	<div class="pLabQASection"><div style= " font:bold 16px arial;">State Your Conclusion</div></div></br>
	<div style="display: inline-block;float: left;">5.</div><div style="display: flex;display: -webkit-flex;padding-left: 23px;">After considering the information in the Think Critically section and reviewing the experiences, observations, data, and calculations of these experiments, state your conclusion. Be sure to compare your results to the laws and theories you have studied and to explain your reasoning.</div>
