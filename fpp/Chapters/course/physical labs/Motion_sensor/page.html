	The motion detector works by emitting short bursts of ultrasonic sound waves. It measures the time it takes the sound pulse to return to precisely locate objects in front of it.

	You will hear a clicking sound when the detector is operating.

	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Discussion</div></br>
	Position, velocity, and acceleration are all related through a branch of mathematics known as calculus. There are also useful graphical interpretations of these concepts. By analyzing a graph or a function of one of these variables, one can find out what is happening with the other two.
	</br></br>
	Position (x) locates an object along an axis. The change in position (displacement) of the object between 2 times is equal to the area under a velocity-time graph.
	</br></br>
	Velocity (v) is the time rate of change of position. Graphically, instantaneous velocity (in one dimension, i.e., along a particular direction) is the slope of the position-time graph.
	</br></br>
	Acceleration (a) is the time rate of change of velocity. On a velocity-time graph, acceleration is the slope, since it measures how fast the velocity is changing. On an acceleration-time graph, the area under the graph is the change in velocity of the object between the 2 times. 
	</br></br>

	If a small wind-up toy moves at constant velocity, what will its position vs. time graph look like? What about its velocity vs. time graph? What about its acceleration vs. time graph?

		1.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Connect your interface box to your computer, plug in the power supply, and turn on the interface.
		</br></br>
		2.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Mount your ultrasonic motion sensor on a ring stand, using clamps and 90-degree rod clamps.
		</br></br>
		3.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Connect the sensor to the interface box.
		</br></br>
		4.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Orient the motion sensor so it points along the table at the wind-up toy. Make sure you can watch the computer display as the toy moves. 
		</br></br>
		5.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Start the computer program and ask it to display graphs of position, velocity, and acceleration against time.
		</br></br>
		6.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Wind up the toy and set it on the table.
		</br></br>
		7.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Start taking data. You may hear a clicking noise from the ultrasonic sensor.
		</br></br>
		8.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Choose your best run for further analysis. To curve fit the data, click the "Fit" icon located just above the graph, with a "Linear Fit" option. The program will display information about the line of best fit through your data. 
		</br></br>
		9.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Record the equation of the line of best fit for your position data using the slope and intercept shown by the "Linear Fit" function. The standard equation for a linear fit is y = m×x + b, where m is the slope and b is the y intercept. In this case, the slope of the position data, which is the derivative of the linear function, represents the velocity.

	If a toy car is allowed to roll down an inclined plane, the component of gravity down the plane will give it a constant acceleration.

		1.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Set up an inclined plane by putting a small object under one end of a flat board or something similar.
		</br></br>
		2.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Measure the angle of inclination from the horizontal using a protractor, or by making linear measurements and using trigonometry.
		</br></br>
		3.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Set up the data acquisition sensor as before, only now, clamp the motion sensor with the ring stand, clamps, and 90-degree clamps so that it points down the inclined plane, parallel to its surface.
		</br></br>
		4.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Start the computer program and ask it to display graphs of position, velocity, and acceleration against time.
		</br></br>
		5.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Set the toy car at the top of the inclined plane, about 10 cm in front of the motion sensor.
		</br></br>
		6.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Let go of the car, and start taking data. You may hear a clicking noise from the ultrasonic sensor.
		</br></br>
		7.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Choose your best run for further analysis. To curve fit the data, click the "Fit" icon located just above the graph, with a "Linear Fit" option if the data points fall on a straight line, or a “Quadratic Fit” or “second-degree fit” if the data points fall on a parabola (a special kind of curve). The program will display information about the best fit through your data. 
		</br></br>
		8.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp By looking at the parameters of your best fit lines and parabolas, you will be able to determine the acceleration of the car. How do the numbers compare to what you expect from theory? 
	</div>
	</br><div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Is Your Data Reasonable?</div></br>
	In order to determine if your data is reasonable, consider the following questions:
	</br></br>
	1.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If you know a formula that relates the values you measured, does your data match those values?
 	</br></br>
	2.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If you have calculated any values, are those values reasonable based on the data used for the calculation?
 	</br></br>
	3.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Are you getting the same general results as other lab groups are getting?
 	</br></br>
	4.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If the answer to any question above is “no,” it does NOT mean your lab results are wrong. But you may want to try to retake some measurements, for example, remeasuring the current through a resistor, to see if you get the same results as before.
