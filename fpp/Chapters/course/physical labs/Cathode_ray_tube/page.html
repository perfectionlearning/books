<div class="pLabPageIntro">
	The development of television was based on the development of the cathode ray tube (CRT). A CRT, also known as a picture tube, was found in all TV sets up until the relatively recent invention of alternative technologies such as plasma or LCD televisions. 
	</br></br>
	A cathode ray tube is a glass tube, evacuated of air (making it a vacuum tube). It contains a metal cathode (held at negative electric potential) and an anode (positive potential). A cathode ray is a stream of electrons leaving the cathode. Often the electrons are emitted by a heated filament. Electrons are accelerated from negative to positive potential through the vacuum.

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Safety</div>
	Safety is a primary concern with this equipment. Even low voltages can be dangerous. The appropriate grounding of metal parts should be done, as well as the correct insulation of all electrical components. Anyone near the equipment should be on an insulated surface.
	</br></br>
	The CRT is a specialized piece of equipment. Please watch the Perfection video on its use and consult the instructions for your specific piece of equipment.
	</br></br>
	You will also be using a power supply. Again, consult the Perfection video and the vendorâ€™s safety manual for safety instructions.
	</br></br>
	<b>General Lab Safety:</b>
	</br></br>
	Observe all procedures detailed by your instructor.
	</br></br>
	Keep a clean and orderly work space.
	</br></br>
	If you break or spill something, notify your instructor immediately.
	</br></br>
	If someone needs first aid, notify your instructor immediately.
	</br></br>
	When you have completed an experiment, always dispose of, recycle, or store equipment and supplies in their proper locations.
	</br></br>
	If in doubt: Ask!
	</br></br>

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Question 1</div>
	</br>
	If electrons flow from cathode to anode through the tube, what will be the effect of placing a magnet near the CRT?
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Hypothesis</div></br>
	A hypothesis is a brief statement that describes what you expect your experiment to show. You know the right hand rule for predicting the behavior of moving charged particles in a magnetic field. What should happen to the beam of electrons (careful: they are negatively charged) in the magnetic field produced by the horseshoe magnet?
	</br></br>
	Draw a sketch in your lab notebook predicting what will happen, and state your hypothesis for the question above.
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Steps in the Experiment</div></br>
	<div class="pLabQASection">
	<ol start="1" style="list-style-type: decimal;padding-left: 31px;line-height: 32px;">
		<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Apply the filament voltage until the filament glows.</li>
		
		<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Next, apply an accelerating voltage until the beam is emitted. In many CRTs built for physics demonstrations, a phosphor screen (that spans the length of the tube) glows when struck by electrons, making the beam visible.</li>

		<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Check the accelerating voltage with a multimeter.</li>

		<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Place the horseshoe magnet near the tube so that the north pole is on one side and the south pole is on the other. (If in doubt as to which is which, check the polarity using a magnetic compass. The end of the needle that points roughly toward the geographic north pole is a magnetic north pole, and opposite poles attract.) You should notice that the beam bends.

		<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Describe and sketch the results.</li>
