	Permanent magnets are one method of producing magnetic fields. Although these fields cannot be seen by the naked eye, their general shape can be visualized by using iron filings.

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Safety</div>
	Magnets can cause malfunctioning in electronic devices, such as laptops, pacemakers, or portable music players. They can also erase data stored on the “magnetic stripe” on credit cards, etc.
	</br></br>
	Small magnets should be kept away from young children, as they may be swallowed.
	</br></br>
	<b>General Lab Safety:</b>
	</br></br>
	Observe all procedures detailed by your instructor.
	</br></br>
	Keep a clean and orderly work space.
	</br></br>
	If you break or spill something, notify your instructor immediately.
	</br></br>
	If someone needs first aid, notify your instructor immediately.
	</br></br>
	When you have completed an experiment, always dispose of, recycle, or store equipment and supplies in their proper locations.
	</br></br>
	If in doubt: Ask!
