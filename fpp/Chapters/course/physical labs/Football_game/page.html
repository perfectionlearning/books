<div class="pLabPageIntro">
	Labs can be done inside the school as well as outside. A sporting event is another way to observe physics at work. We will choose American football. You will use physics to investigate the kinetic energy of a football as thrown by the quarterback, and as kicked by the punter.

	</br>
	In Exercise 1, we want you to consider the relationship of the kinetic energy provided by the quarterback to the speed of the football pass.
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Question</div></br>
	</br>
	In what way, if any, does the kinetic energy supplied by the quarterback affect the speed of a football pass?
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Hypothesis</div></br>
	</br>
	State your hypothesis for the question above.
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Design of the Experiment</div></br>
	</br>
	In this experiment you will estimate the speed of a football pass (use a stopwatch) and calculate the kinetic energy the quarterback has supplied as the football leaves his hand. 
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Identify the Variables</div></br>
	Use the following equations:

	6.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Calculate the vertical component of the football’s speed as it leaves the punter’s foot:
	</br></br>
	a.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Divide the measured “hang time” by two to estimate how long it takes to reach the peak of its motion. Record this value in your Data Collection chart for each instance.
	</br></br>
	b.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Use the motion equation provided to calculate its starting speed. (Hint: You know its vertical speed at the peak of tis motion, its vertical acceleration − use g − and the amount of time. That is enough to calculate its starting vertical speed.) Record this value in your Data Collection chart for each instance.
	</br></br>
	7.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Calculate the horizontal component of the football’s speed as it leaves the punter’s foot as you would a pass. Record this value in your Data Collection chart for each instance.
	</br></br>
	8.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Add the calculated vertical speed and the calculated horizontal speed as vectors to calculate the punt’s total speed. Record this value in your Data Collection chart for each instance.

	<div class="pLabQASection"><div style= " font:bold 16px arial;">Is Your Data Reasonable?</div></div></br>
	In order to determine if your data is reasonable, consider the following questions:</br></br></br></br>
	13.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Did you substitute the appropriate values in the equation?
	</br></br>
	14.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Are the calculated values reasonable based on the data used for the calculation?
	</br></br>
	15.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If the answer to any question above is "no", it does NOT mean your lab results are wrong. If other classmates have collected the same data for the same individual and the same pass or punt, compare your data with theirs to determine if you may have measured wrong or written down a wrong number.

	<div class="pLabQASection"><div style= " font:bold 16px arial;">Determine Sources of Uncertainty</div></div></br>

	17.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If your experiments proved your hypotheses, your conclusion is merely a restatement of your hypotheses.
	</br></br>
	18.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If your experiments did not prove your hypotheses, you may have to design additional experiments and form new hypotheses based on your new experimental data. If this is the case, ask your instructor if there is time to redesign and re-run one or more of your experiments.
	</br></br>
	19.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What scientific laws or theories have you studied that support your experiences in these experiments?
	</br></br>
	20.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What technologies might you use to further analyze the game?

	21.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After considering the information in the Think Critically section, and reviewing the experiences, observations, data and calculations of this experiment, state your Conclusion. Be sure to compare your results to the law and theories you have studied and to explain your reasoning.

	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Alternate Field Trip: Observe a Televised Football Game</div></br>
	</br>
	Make similar calculations for college and professional athletes. Record a show, perhaps using a digital video recorder (DVR). How does the energy supplied by college quarterbacks and punters compare to the energy supplied by professional quarterbacks and punters?
	</br></br>
	If you have the opportunity to attend a high school football game, you could also compare the energy supplied by high school quarterbacks and punters with the energy supplied by college and/or professional quarterbacks and punters. 
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Challenge</div></br>
	Compare the energy supplied by a quarterback and football player to the energy supplied by athletes in other sports. For instance, how fast does a baseball pitcher throw a fastball, and what is that kinetic energy? How does a pole-vaulter go, and what does that mean for the amount of energy he must supply for his leap?
