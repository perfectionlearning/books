<div class="pLabPageIntro">
	Labs can be done inside the school as well as outside. A sporting event is another way to observe physics at work. We will choose American football. You will use physics to investigate the kinetic energy of a football as thrown by the quarterback, and as kicked by the punter.

	</br>
	In Exercise 1, we want you to consider the relationship of the kinetic energy provided by the quarterback to the speed of the football pass.
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Question</div></br>
	</br>
	In what way, if any, does the kinetic energy supplied by the quarterback affect the speed of a football pass?
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Hypothesis</div></br>

	State your hypothesis for the question above.
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Design of the Experiment</div></br>
	</br>
	In this experiment you will estimate the speed of a football pass (use a stopwatch) and calculate the kinetic energy the quarterback has supplied as the football leaves his hand. 
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Identify the Variables</div></br>
	Use the following equations:

	Make similar calculations for college and professional athletes. Record a show, perhaps using a digital video recorder (DVR). How does the energy supplied by college quarterbacks and punters compare to the energy supplied by professional quarterbacks and punters?
