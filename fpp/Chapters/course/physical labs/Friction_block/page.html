<div class="pLabPageIntro">
	You will use a friction block to investigate friction between different surfaces. Does friction depend on the normal force or on the speed at which the surfaces slide over one another?
	</br></br>
	Kinetic friction forces are exerted by surfaces sliding on each other. The forces depend on the details of the microscopic contact between the sliding surfaces. Consequently, friction forces vary with the materials in contact, the state of each surface (smoothness, cleanliness, etc.), and the force pressing the surfaces together.

	<b>General Lab Safety:</b>
	</br></br>
	Observe all procedures detailed by your instructor.
	</br></br>
	Keep a clean and orderly work space.
	</br></br>
	If you break or spill something, notify your instructor immediately.
	</br></br>
	If someone needs first aid, notify your instructor immediately.
	</br></br>
	When you have completed an experiment, always dispose of, recycle, or store equipment and supplies in their proper locations.

	</br>
	The coefficient of kinetic friction (m<sub>K</sub>) is the ratio of the kinetic frictional force to the normal force (the perpendicular force pressing the surfaces together). Doubling the normal force roughly doubles the friction force, so m<sub>K</sub> is approximately constant.
	</br></br>
	In this experiment, these properties of kinetic friction will be tested for several surface pairs.

	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Discussion</div></br>
	</br>
	Static friction resists the sliding motion of two objects that are stationary relative to one another. The coefficient of static friction (m<sub>S</sub>) is the ratio of the maximum static frictional force to the normal force (the perpendicular force pressing the surfaces together). 
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Question</div></br>
	</br>
	You can use a friction block on an inclined plane to calculate the coefficient of static friction between two materials. As the plane is inclined more and more from the horizontal, at some point the block just begins to slide. At that moment, what is the relationship between the static friction coefficient and the angle of inclination of the plane from the horizontal?

		<li style = "padding-left:15px;">Now, repeat the experiment and incline it just a hair less. The plane is now at the angle at which the maximum force of static friction just balances the component of the blockâ€™s weight that is directed down the plane. </li>
