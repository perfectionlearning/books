	Ballistic pendulums involve moving objects. Be sure that nothing is in the way when the projectile is launched and when the pendulum swings upward.
	</br></br>
	<b>General Lab Safety:</b>
	</br></br>
	Observe all procedures detailed by your instructor.
	</br></br>
	Keep a clean and orderly work space.
	</br></br>
	If you break or spill something, notify your instructor immediately.
	</br></br>
	If someone needs first aid, notify your instructor immediately.
	</br></br>
	When you have completed an experiment, always dispose of, recycle or store equipment and supplies in their proper location.
	</br></br>
	If in doubt: Ask!

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Question 1</div>
	</br>
	A ballistic pendulum is used to measure the speed of a small, fast-moving object (such as a bullet or ball). In this lab, you will fire a ball at the pendulum. Both the ball and pendulum will rise together.
	</br></br>
	In later trials, you can fire the balls at different velocities, or you may have different balls to fire.
	</br></br>
	Do you expect momentum to be conserved during the collision? How about kinetic energy?
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Hypothesis</div></br>
	A hypothesis is a brief statement that describes what you expect your experiment to show.
	</br></br>
	State your hypothesis for the question above.

	<div class="pLabQASection">
		1.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Put on your safety goggles.
		</br></br>
		2.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Place a ball in the projectile launcher. Measure its mass by using a digital scale or a triple beam balance.
		</br></br>
		3.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Measure the mass of the pendulum.
		</br></br>
		4.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Set the velocity of the launcher.
		</br></br>
		5.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Launch the ball.
		</br></br>
		6.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Note the height to which the pendulum rises.
		</br></br>
		7.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Repeat this experiment several times.
		</br></br>
		8.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If you have different mass balls, repeat the experiment with different mass balls.

	</br></br>
	Momentum is conserved in any collision, inelastic or elastic, when no net external forces act. You can consult your textbook for more on momentum conservation.
	</br></br>
	The initial momentum of the system is mv. We use lowercase letters for the mass and velocity of the ball.
	</br></br>
	Immediately after the collision, the momentum is (m + M)V. We use uppercase letters for the mass of the pendulum and its velocity.We can write an equation for the velocity of the pendulum and ball immediately after the collision.
	</br></br>
	mv = (m + M)V
	</br></br>
	We can solve this equation for the initial velocity of the ball:
	</br></br>

	</br></br>
	There is some energy loss during the totally inelastic collision, but immediately after the collision, energy is conserved. Both the ball and the pendulum are moving at velocity V. At the peak of the motion, all the mechanical energy is in gravitational potential energy. The variable h represents how high the combined ball/pendulum rises.

	<div class="pLabQASection">
		9.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If your equipment allows you to measure the speed of the pendulum immediately after the collision: From the final height, solve the second equation for the velocity of the pendulum plus ball immediately after the collision. How does your value compare to the speed of the pendulum that you observe?
		</br></br>
		10.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Use the first equation to solve for the initial velocity of the fast-moving ball as a function of the height of the pendulum, the two masses, and g.
		</br></br>
		11.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Is kinetic energy conserved 100% in this collision, from the very beginning of the experiment until the end? If not, explain why.
		</br></br>
		12.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Explain any errors that the lab equipment might have introduced.
