	You will use a trajectory apparatus to investigate projectile motion, i.e., uniformly accelerated motion in two dimensions.
	</br></br>
	In this experiment, you will photograph a ball in flight using a stroboscope and a digital camera. The strobe effect will result in a succession of images being recorded on the photograph at equal time intervals. At each time increment, the ball's position (x and y coordinates) will be measured directly from the digital photograph.

	This experiment involves moving objects. Be sure that nothing is in the way when the projectile is launched.
	</br></br>
	Stroboscopes can be dangerous to look at and can cause injury to people with certain medical conditions.
	</br></br>
	<b>General Lab Safety:</b>
	</br></br>
	Observe all procedures detailed by your instructor.
	</br></br>
	Keep a clean and orderly work space.
	</br></br>
	If you break or spill something, notify your instructor immediately.
	</br></br>
	If someone needs first aid, notify your instructor immediately.
	</br></br>
	When you have completed an experiment, always dispose of, recycle, or store equipment and supplies in their proper locations.
	</br></br>
	If in doubt: Ask!

	Your textbook will contain background information about projectile motion. In brief, the equations for an object undergoing motion with a constant acceleration a in one dimension are:

	where d is the position at time t, v is the velocity at time t, d<sub>i</sub> is the initial position and v<sub>i</sub> is the initial velocity.
	</br></br>
	In projectile motion, these relations are applied to each direction (horizontal and vertical) separately.</br>

	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Question</div></br>
	</br></br>
	What is the acceleration a, when considering the horizontal motion? What about vertical motion?

	<div class="pLabQASection">
		1.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   Set up the launcher, meterstick, camera, and stroboscope so as to photograph the flight of the ball against a black background.
		</br></br>
		2.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The plumb line should be in the photo so that the direction of true vertical may be determined.
		</br></br>
		3.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  The meterstick should be in the frame of the photo and parallel to the plumb line, so that you can translate the “photographic” coordinates to “real-life” coordinates. 
		</br></br>
		4.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Keep the shutter of the camera open for 2-5 seconds for optimal results.
		</br></br>
		5.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ensure that the exit ramp of the launcher is horizontal.
		</br></br>
		6.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Set the strobe to flash at a rate of 30 flashes/sec. This means that successive images of the ball on your photograph will be separated by 1/30 of a second. 
		</br></br>
		7.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  With the lights out and the stroboscope flashing, one student pushes the shutter button. Another student releases the ball immediately after the shutter button is pressed.
		</br></br>
		8.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  You will see the captured image on the camera display. You should have a photograph with approximately 10 images of the ball, separated in time by 1/30 of a second.

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Discussion and Analysis</div>
	</br>
	On the computer, open the photo with Paint®, and rotate the photograph using the software until the plumb line is vertical. 
	</br></br>
	Find the scale factor of your photo. To do so, place the computer cursor on two points on the meterstick that are visible in the photograph. You can read off the “pixel coordinates” from the computer program. Since you know the “real-life” separation of the two selected points, you now have a scale factor that will allow you to translate pixel coordinates to real-life x-y coordinates.
	</br></br>
	For example, if 0.30 m on the meter stick corresponds to 3000 pixels on the photograph, then your scale factor is 0.30m/3000 pixels = 1E-4 meters/pixel.
	</br></br>
	Enlarge the photo enough so that you can see the white dots corresponding to the images of the ball. Place the cursor over each dot and read the coordinates displayed in the lower right corner of the Paint® window. Record these coordinates as “X(pixels)” and “Y(pixels).” Convert them to real-life coordinates by multiplying by the scale factor you determined earlier.
	</br></br>
	Let t = 0 correspond to the location of the first image of the ball. Make a graph of x versus t and do a straight line fit.
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Question</div></br>
	Why should this be a straight line? What is the interpretation of the slope?
	</br></br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Hypothesis</div></br>
	A hypothesis is a brief statement that describes what you expect your experiment to show.
	</br></br>
	State your hypothesis for the question above.
	</br></br>
	Now consider the y-values. Calculate the average velocity in the y direction for each interval of 1/15 sec; for example, for the interval between position 3 and position 5, the average velocity in the y direction is </br>
	<img src= "course/physical labs/Trajectory_apparatus/assets/image111.gif" style="vertical-align:middle;">.	Do this for each point in your data table.
	</br></br>
	If the acceleration is constant, the average velocity that you calculate in this way is equal to the instantaneous velocity at t<sub>4</sub>. Calculate the instantaneous y-velocity for each of the times in your experiment (except for the first and the last).
	</br></br>
	Make a plot of v<sub>y</sub> vs. t and do a straight line fit.

	Why should this be a straight line? What is the interpretation of the slope? Can you check the slope of your line and find the percentage deviation from a “true value”?
