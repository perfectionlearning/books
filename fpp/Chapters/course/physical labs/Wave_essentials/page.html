	Waves can be longitudinal (the motion of particles is the same as the direction in which the wave is traveling) or transverse (perpendicular to the direction in which the wave is traveling).
	</br></br>
	You will use a slinky spring to show both kinds of waves.
	</br></br>
	You can also investigate properties such as the power, frequency, wavelength, amplitude, and speed of a wave. You can see which properties are related and which are not. Finally, you will investigate how waves interfere with one another.

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Safety</div>
	Wave motion ropes can catch on objects and choke people. Stroboscopes can be dangerous to look at and can cause injury to people with certain medical conditions. Slinky springs are fun to play with and can be distracting. Concentrate on the lab! 
	</br></br>
	<b>General Lab Safety:</b>
	</br></br>
	Observe all procedures detailed by your instructor.
	</br></br>
	Keep a clean and orderly work space.
	</br></br>
	If you break or spill something, notify your instructor immediately.
	</br></br>
	If someone needs first aid, notify your instructor immediately.
	</br></br>
	When you have completed an experiment, always dispose of, recycle, or store equipment and supplies in their proper locations.
	</br></br>
	If in doubt: Ask!

	What are the two types of waves? How can you generate them with a slinky spring?

	A hypothesis is a brief statement that describes what you expect your experiment to show. State your hypothesis for the question above.

	<div class="pLabQASection">
		1.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Connecting 3 or 4 slinky springs together with wire to form a long chain may make the experiment more effective, but even 1 will work.

		2.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You and a lab partner hold different ends of the spring. Shake it up and down.

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Question 2</div>
	</br>
	What is the relationship between power and frequency? In other words, if you double the frequency at which you shake the end of the spring, are you supplying the same amount of power to do this as before, twice as much, or more? In your experiment, you will estimate the results.

	A hypothesis is a brief statement that describes what you expect your experiment to show. For example, in this case, you want to decide if the momentum of each object will increase, decrease, or remain the same after a collision.

		5.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If you have a stroboscope, set it and shake the spring so that a marked location on your spring reaches its endpoint of motion exactly when the light flashes. Then double the frequency of the stroboscope, and again attempt to have the same marked location on the spring reach its peak exactly when the light flashes. Alternatively, you may use a metronome and try to hit the peak with each “tick” that you hear.
