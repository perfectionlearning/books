<div class="pLabPageIntro">
	A discharge tube is a gas-filled tube which contains electrodes, typically in a glass tube. The gas in the tube is of one type, and typical examples include hydrogen, helium, neon and argon.

	Even low voltages can be dangerous. Make sure that the power supply is in good working order, with appropriate grounding of metal parts, and insulation of all electrical component where appropriates.
	</br></br>
	The discharge tube is a specialized piece of equipment. Please watch the Perfection video on its use and consult the instructions for your specific piece of equipment.
	</br></br>
	You will also be using a power supply. Again, consult the Perfection video and the vendor’s safety manual for safety instructions.

	<b>General Lab Safety:</b>
	</br></br>
	Observe all procedures detailed by your instructor.
	</br></br>
	Keep a clean and orderly work space.
	</br></br>
	If you break or spill something, notify your instructor immediately.
	</br></br>
	If someone needs first aid, notify your instructor immediately.
	</br></br>
	When you have completed an experiment, always dispose of, recycle or store equipment and supplies in their proper location.
	</br></br>
	If in doubt: Ask!

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Question 1</div>
	</br>
	A major advance in understanding atomic structure came with the hydrogen atom model, proposed by Niels Bohr. The electron was assumed to be in a circular orbit about the proton, held there by electrostatic attraction. Bohr postulated that only certain orbits are allowed. The orbits are labeled by the “quantum number” n, which takes on positive integer values: n = 1, 2, 3, ... The n = 1 orbit (“the ground state”) has the lowest energy. The electron is usually found in the ground state and tends to move toward that state when in a higher energy state.
	</br></br>
	Bohr further postulated that an electron can change orbits only by absorbing or emitting a single photon, whose energy is equal to the energy difference between the two levels. (Energy is absorbed if the new orbit has higher energy than the original orbit, and energy is emitted if it has lower energy.)
	</br></br>
	When energy is emitted or absorbed, it appears in the form of electromagnetic energy, a single photon of light. The frequency or wavelength of the photon (i.e., the color of the light) is related to the energy.
	</br></br>
	In this lab, electrons are bumped up to higher energy levels by a high electric potential, and they cascade down to the ground level, emitting photos as they fall, producing an emission spectrum. Bohr concluded that the emission spectrum for different gases should be unique, consisting of a characteristic set of wavelengths. The particular “fingerprint” for each gas corresponds to the differences in energy between the various energy levels.
	</br></br>
	Aim your handheld visual spectroscope at a mini incandescent light bulb in a socket, powered by a battery. You will see a continuous spectrum. You will see the same thing if you look at a sunlight-illuminated cloud. NOTE: NEVER point your instrument directly at the sun! Permanent eye damage could result.
	</br></br>
	Next, aim your handheld visual spectroscope at the gas discharge tube. Do you expect a continuous spectrum of emission lines, or only a handful of narrow emission lines?

	A hypothesis is a brief statement that describes what you expect your experiment to show. State your hypothesis for the question above.

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Question 2</div>
	</br>
	Find out what gas is in your discharge tube (if you have it, it is best to start with hydrogen gas, the simplest atom). Look up the typical energy levels for that gas. Referring to your textbook, a periodic table, and to an electromagnetic spectrum chart, predict some of the wavelengths in the visible spectrum that you will see.
