<div class="pLabPageIntro">
	The Geiger-Müller (GM) radiation detector is a gas-filled, cylindrical chamber in which a pair of electrodes collects electron-ion pairs.
	</br></br>
	High voltage is applied to a wire running along the axis of the low-pressure gas chamber, while the cylindrical conducting wall is grounded. A thin window at the bottom of the chamber (generally made of mica) allows penetrating radiation to ionize atoms of the gas mixture. Electrons drift to the center and positive ions drift to the wall. The resulting electrical pulse is amplified and sent to an electronic counter.
	</br></br>
	Alpha and beta particles are charged and interact directly with atoms in the gas mixture. Gamma rays (high energy photons) are uncharged and are detected when they strike the chamber wall.

	<b>General Lab Safety:</b>
	</br></br>
	Observe all procedures detailed by your instructor.
	</br></br>
	Keep a clean and orderly work space.

	If you break or spill something, notify your instructor immediately.
	</br></br>
	If someone needs first aid, notify your instructor immediately.
	</br></br>
	When you have completed an experiment, always dispose of, recycle, or store equipment and supplies in their proper locations.

	</br>
	<div style= "color:#41959b; font:bold 16px arial;">Discussion</div></br>
	In this experiment, you will determine the best operating voltage for your GM tube. If a radioactive sample is placed under the tube and the voltage is slowly increased, no counts at all will be detected until the tube reaches its starting potential. After that, a slight increase in voltage will result in a rapid increase in count rate. This voltage is known as the threshold.
	</br></br>
	As the voltage is increased past the threshold, the counting rate will stay fairly constant over a range of voltages. This region of operating voltage is known as the Geiger plateau.
	</br></br>
	If the voltage is turned too high, past the plateau, the tube is in “continuous discharge” mode and will be ruined quickly.

		1.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Turn on the instrument with the voltage set as low as possible, and allow it to warm up for the amount of time specified by the manufacturer. 
		</br></br>
		2.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Place a prepared beta source into the tube stand below the GM tube.
		</br></br>
		3.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Reset the instrument so that the counts are at zero.
		</br></br>
		4.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Observe and record the number of counts per minute at the lowest voltage.
		</br></br>
		5.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Plot the counts per minute vs. voltage as you proceed, so that you can see the shape of the graph as it develops.
		</br></br>
		6.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Increase the voltage by 25 or 50 volts, and try again.
		</br></br>
		7.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp In order to prevent continuous discharge, do not let the count rate rise more than 10% above the plateau value.
		</br></br>
		8.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspDetermine the best operating voltage for the tube. The “best” voltage to operate at is chosen within the plateau, generally in the lower 1/4 of it, which helps preserve tube life.

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Experiment 2: Background Radiation</div>
	</br>
	On Earth, we are constantly being exposed to a wide variety of natural radiation. Sources include cosmic rays and radioactive atoms in our bodies, our food, and our environment. This radiation adds to the count that we record from a sample, so it causes us to overcount activity, especially when the sample activity is not very high. 
	</br></br>
	To make accurate measurements, we must determine the background count and correct our data for it.

	How might you design an experiment to measure the background count?

	<div class="pExcersiseTitle">Experiment 3: Measuring Shelf Ratios</div>
	</br>
	Radiation exits a source in all directions, but only a small fraction is detected by the radiation counter. This fraction depends on R, the distance from the point source of radiation to the GM tube. If the source is moved farther from the GM tube, the amount of radiation being counted will roughly follow an inverse square relationship.
	</br></br>
	Sometimes, if a source is too active, it is placed on a lower shelf of the tube stand, or if it is very weak, it is placed on a higher shelf closer to the tube to obtain a suitable counting rate. However, if we wish to compare the activities of 2 samples that were not measured on the same shelf, it becomes necessary to measure the shelf ratio so that we can make an accurate comparison.
	</br></br>
	In this experiment, we explore the effect of distance upon the intensity of radiation and measure the shelf ratios of a sample holder.

		22.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Assign to shelf #1 a shelf ratio of 1.00. Calculate the shelf ratios for the other shelves by dividing the cpm for shelf #1 into the cpm for each of the other shelves.
