			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Beginning/Intermediate:</span>  Pronounce each word and have students repeat after you. Then use realia; simple, accessible language; and/or gestures to help students understand. For example, for the term <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">nearsightedness</span>, write this phrase on the board: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">People who are nearsighted can’t see faraway things.</span> Then stand at the back of the room and pretend not to be able to read the words, saying that you are nearsighted. If you wear glasses, take them off and explain that your glasses correct your <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">nearsightedness</span>, and without them, you can’t see faraway things. <span class="Body-Handwrite char-style-override-2">Without my glasses, my nearsightedness makes the words blurry.</span> Further explain that if you were to drive without your glasses, the road signs would be blurry because of your <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">nearsightedness</span>. Then ask students who have glasses to come to the back of the room, remove their glasses, and try to read the sentence. Ask them if the words are blurry. If so, explain that they have glasses to correct their <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">nearsightedness</span>. </p>
			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Advanced/Advanced High: </span>See<span class="Body-Bold"> Beginning/Intermediate. </span> Ask students to define <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">nearsightedness</span> in their own words.

			<p class="Body-A">Make sure to preview key vocabulary that might impair understanding. Use strategies such as the following.</p>
			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Beginning/Intermediate:</span> Discuss the common meaning of the key vocabulary. For example, begin by discussing the word <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">critical</span>. Explain that <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">critical</span> means <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">important</span> or <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">necessary</span>, as in <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">Learning new vocabulary is critical.</span> Explain the common meaning of <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">angle</span> by drawing one where everyone can see and writing the word. Remind students of the meaning of <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">angle</span> as “the point where two lines meet.”</p>
			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Beginning/Intermediate/Advanced/Advanced High</span>: Explain the physics meaning of <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">critical angle </span>as the “minimum angle at which total internal reflection occurs.” Then ask students to relate the common meaning of the key words to the physics meaning.</p>
			<p class="Body-Indent">Use the 2-Column Notes graphic organizer in the Student Activities and suggest that students record the key vocabulary in the left column and its cognate in the right column. Ask students to keep completed 2-Column Notes in a physics notebook for reference.			</p>

			<p class="Body-A">Use strategies that represent different modalities to support second language learners as they interact with the content.</p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Whiteboards</span>  Pair <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced</span> students and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced High</span> students to study the whiteboards that introduce new concepts. Encourage the partners to begin by listening to the oral explanation that accompanies all whiteboards as they first view the new concept, providing visual and auditory support. Then encourage partners to go step-by-step through the whiteboards again with the more advanced student pointing out and reading the explanation text. Encourage the <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> students to question their partners for clarification. Suggest that all students use the T-Chart Notes graphic organizer from the Student Activities for recording formulas and summarizing concepts in their native language or English, depending on their language proficiency. Encourage students to keep their notes in a physics notebook for handy reference.</p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Videos  </span>Pair <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced</span> students and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced High</span> students to view videos that introduce academic vocabulary and key concepts. Encourage discussion between partners and have them use the T-Chart Notes graphic organizer for recording formulas and summarizing concepts in their native language or English, depending on their language proficiency. Encourage students to discuss and review their notes to help them prepare for exams.</p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Vocabulary</span>  Before students complete each page, review any pertinent vocabulary. Write the unknown words on the board and ask volunteers to draw a sketch or write a synonym or definition for each. Although many of the pages have images, students may not know which part of the image refers to the vocabulary, so it is helpful to have them preview the vocabulary. Have students use a copy of the Chapter 21 Vocabulary reproducible in the Student Activities to record cognates, definitions in their native language, or diagrams to help them understand and remember.</p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet-indent-only">&#9;Pertinent Vocabulary: Topic 21.1: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">helicopter, fire, submarines, crossover, dashed, media/medium; </span>Topic 21.5: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">adjoining, window, pane of glass, newspaper; </span>Topic 21.6: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">ice, pavement, spear, fish, fisherman, compressed; </span>Topic 21.9: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">fiber optic cables; </span>Topic 21.11: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">prism, raindrop; </span>Topic 21.13: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">spherical; </span>Topic 21.14: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">principal axis, </span><span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">photographers, camera sensor; </span>Topic 21.16: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">eye, brain, blurry, relaxed; </span>Topic 21.17: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">laser eye surgery, surgeon. </span>Remind students to file their Chapter 21 Vocabulary sheets in their physics notebooks. </p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Language of Math/Science</span>  Record the following terms on the board: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">ratio, product, pair, numerator, denominator, angle, parallel, infinitely variable, proportional, square, diameter, </span>and <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">inverted</span>. Read through the list slowly as students repeat. Then read each term again and ask students to give a thumbs-up or thumbs-down based on whether they are familiar with each word. Finally, pair <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced</span> or <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced/High</span> students to group the words by how they relate to each other. For example, <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">ratio, numerator, denominator</span> and <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">proportional</span> are words that have to do with division/ratios, so these words could go together. Explain to students that there are many correct groupings for the words, but students will need to be ready to explain their reasoning for the groupings they choose. When pairs complete their groupings, have a class sharing and discussion of the meanings of each term, the groupings, and the reasoning for each.</p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Everyday Applications</span>  Divide students into multilevel groups. Ask groups to find Websites that discuss laser eye surgery and read about the surgery, looking for terms from this chapter and determining whether the Websites are using the terms the same way the chapter does. Have a class discussion during which each group shares a few examples.</p>

Ask the native language speakers to read the directions aloud and then model how to perform the activity. Encourage them to use metacognition, or think-alouds, as they play, explaining what they are doing and why as their partners observe. Encourage second language students to request clarification and, when they are ready, to enjoy the interactive activity themselves. Suggest that students complete a Think, Pair, Share template together once they complete the activity. The template can be found in the Student Activities.
