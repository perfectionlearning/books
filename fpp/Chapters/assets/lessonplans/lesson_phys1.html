      <p class="Body-A">Before introducing advanced math terms necessary for physics and presented in this chapter, review basic mathematical operations and the associated technical vocabulary. Share four flashcards—one with an addition problem, another with a subtraction problem, one with a multiplication problem, and a fourth with a division problem. As you share each card, pronounce the operation featured and ask students to repeat. Then write the following terms that are associated with the operations for all to see. As you discuss each one, point it out on the flashcard and ask students to repeat. Then review by posting the four flashcards and having students select the relevant term as you point out the examples on the flashcards. Call on individual students to point out the appropriate card or symbol as you say the terms.</p>
      <p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;Addition, add, sum, plus sign</p>

			<p class="Body-A"><img src="assets/lessonplans/images/chart_ch1.gif" width="460" height="109" alt="velocity"></p>
			<p class="Body-A">Explain, act out, and define the academic vocabulary your students will need to master to understand this chapter. Use strategies such as those suggested below for each word. Then have the students complete a vocabulary card for each term. A printable Vocabulary Card template can be found in the Student Activities. </p>
			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Beginning:</span> Pronounce each word and have students repeat after you. Then use realia; simple, accessible language; and/or gestures to help students understand. For example, for the terms <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">velocity, constant velocity, average velocity,</span> and <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">instantaneous velocity, </span>use a toy car. Tape off a “one mile” area for the car to travel on the floor. Invite volunteers to push the car, trying to maintain a constant velocity. </p>
			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate:</span> See <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning.</span> Then discuss what the average velocity and instantaneous velocity might be and how they compare. <span class="Body-Handwrite">What do you think average velocity means? What do you think instantaneous velocity means?</span> Record correct definitions on the board, inserting changes as necessary. </p>
			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Advanced/Advanced High:</span> Then ask students to think about how they might calculate the average velocity or instantaneous velocity of the car. <span class="Body-Handwrite">What information do we need to figure out the average or instantaneous velocity? What equation might we use?</span> Guide students in creating an average/instantaneous velocity equation on the board. </p>

			<!-- <p class="Body-A">(1.A1, 1.A2, 1.B1, 1.C, 1.D, 1.F, 2.C1, 2.C2, 2.C3, 2.C4, 2.D1, 2.D2, 2.E3, 2.I3, 2.I4, 3.B3, 3.D1, 3.D2, 3.E, 3.F2, 3.G2, 3.H3, 4.C2, 4.D, 4.F1, 4.F2, 4.F3, 4.F5, 4.F6, 4.F7, 4.F8, 4.F10, 4.G3)</p> -->
			<p class="Body-A">Make sure to preview key vocabulary that might impair understanding. Use strategies such as the following.</p>
			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Beginning/Intermediate: </span>Use environmental print to introduce the word <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">speed</span>. Display a photo of a Speed Limit sign, or if there is one near the school, go outside to the sign. Point out the word <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">speed</span> and ask students what it says. Explain that <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">speed</span> is how fast something moves. Say, <span class="Body-Handwrite">This number tells drivers how fast they can legally drive their cars.</span> </p>
			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Advanced/Advanced High:</span> See <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning/Intermediate.</span> Explain the physics meaning of <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">speed</span> as “the distance traveled per unit of time.” Ask these students to relate the common meaning to the physics meaning.</p>
			<p class="Body-Indent">Use the 2-Column Notes graphic organizer in the Student Activities and suggest that students record the key vocabulary in the left column and its cognate or meaning in the right column. Ask students to keep completed 2-Column Notes in a physics notebook for reference.</p>
			<p class="Head-Sub1"><a id="major"></a>Teach Major Concepts</p>
			<!-- <p class="Body-A">(1.A1, 1.A2, 1.B1, 1.C, 1.D, 1.F, 2.C3, 2.C4, 2.D1, 2.D2, 2.E3, 2.I2, 2.I3, 2.I4, 2.I5, 3.B2, 3.B3, 3.C3, 3.C4, 3.D1, 3.D2, 3.E, 3.F1, 3.F2, 3.G1, 3.G2, 3.H3, 4.C1, 4.C2, 4.C3, 4.D, 4.F1, 4.F2, 4.F3, 4.F5, 4.F6, 4.F7, 4.F8, 4.F9, 4.F10, 4.G2, 4.G3)</p> -->
			<p class="Body-A">Use strategies that represent different modalities to support second language learners as they interact with the content.</p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Whiteboards</span>  Pair <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced</span> students and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced High</span> students to study the whiteboards that introduce new concepts. Encourage the partners to begin by listening to the oral explanation that accompanies all whiteboards as they first view the new concept, providing visual and auditory support. Then encourage partners to go step-by-step through the whiteboards again with the more advanced student pointing out and reading the explanation text. Encourage the <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> students to question their partners for clarification. Suggest that all students use the T-Chart Notes graphic organizer from the Student Activities for recording formulas and summarizing concepts in their native language or English, depending on their language proficiency. Encourage students to keep their notes in a physics notebook for handy reference.</p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Videos  </span>Pair <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced</span> students and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced High</span> students to view videos that introduce academic vocabulary and key concepts. Encourage discussion between partners and have them use the T-Chart Notes graphic organizer for recording formulas and summarizing concepts in their native language or English, depending on their language proficiency. Encourage students to discuss and review their notes to help them prepare for exams.</p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Vocabulary</span>  Before students complete each section, review any pertinent vocabulary. Write the unknown words on the board and discuss each. Use realia; simple, accessible language; and/or gestures to define each. Have students use a copy of the Chapter 1 Vocabulary reproducible in the Student Activities to record cognates, definitions in their native language, or diagrams to help them understand and remember. </p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet-indent-only">&#9;Pertinent Vocabulary: Topic 1.1: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">simulation;</span> Topic 1.3: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">variables; </span><span xml:lang="en-US">Topic 1.4:</span><span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US"> rate; </span><span xml:lang="en-US"><span xml:lang="en-US">Topic 1.15:</span></span><span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US"><span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US"> ripped off, critters;</span></span>Topic 1.12:<em> journey</em>, <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">trip; </span>Topic 1.18: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">runner</span>. Remind students to file their Chapter 1 Vocabulary sheets in their physics notebooks.</p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Cultural Differences</span>  Remember as you discuss concepts such as <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">acceleration</span> and <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">velocity</span> that most students will come from countries that use kilometers instead of miles. You may want to complete some equations, calculating in kilometers instead of miles, comparing how the velocity or acceleration changes.</p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Everyday Applications</span>  Divide students into multilevel groups. Give each group a car advertisement from an online source, newspaper, or magazine. Ask groups to read the ads and identify physics concepts that they’ve learned in this chapter. Challenge students to determine if the ads are using the physics or common definitions for the concepts. Have a class sharing during which each group shares a few examples.</p>
			<p class="Heading-1-A-A"><a id="practice"></a>Practice</p>
			<p class="Body-A">Support second language learners as they practice new concepts by interfacing with Kinetic Books interactive content. </p>
			<!-- <p class="Body-A">(1.F, 2.C3, 2.C4, 2.D1, 2.D2, 2.I3, 2.I4, 2.I5, 3.B2, 3.D1, 3.D2, 3.E, 3.F1, 3.F2, 3.H3, 4.C1, 4.C3, 4.C4, 4.D, 4.E, 4.F1, 4.F2, 4.F3, 4.F5, 4.F6, 4.F7, 4.F8, 4.F9, 4.F10, 4.G2, 4.G3, 4.G4)</p> -->
			<p class="Body-Number-Decimal">1.)&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Interactive Activities</span>  Pair second language students with native language speakers for these “hands-on” activities. Ask the native language speakers to read the directions aloud and then model how to perform the activity. Encourage them to use metacognition, or think-alouds, as they play, explaining what they are doing and why as their partners observe. Encourage second language students to request clarification and, when they are ready, to enjoy the interactive activity themselves. Suggest that students complete a Think, Pair, Share template together once they complete the activity. The template can be found in the Student Activities. Then provide time for both partners to share with the group what they have learned from the interactive activity. </p>
			<p class="Body-Number-Decimal">2.)&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Quickchecks</span>  Project Quickchecks on a screen or whiteboard for all ELL students. Read through each problem as ELL students solve them independently by writing their answers on paper. Then have students enter their answers and check, encouraging them to use the Step function for additional help. </p>
			<p class="Body-Number-Decimal">3.)&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Practice Chapter Test </span> Project the practice chapter test on a screen or whiteboard and read the problems as second language students write their answers independently. Then pair <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced</span> students and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced High</span> students to view and check answers and review specific sections. Encourage them to discuss concepts as they review sections. Suggest they refer to their physics notebooks. </p>
			<p class="Body-Number-Decimal">4.)&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Summary Videos</span>  Pair <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced</span> students and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced High</span> students to view videos that summarize key concepts. Encourage discussion between partners. Have them refer to their physics notebooks as they view the videos and review and discuss the concepts. </p></div>
