			<p class="Body-A">Before introducing physics terms presented in this chapter, review the following physics concepts from previous chapters: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">velocity, vector, speed, direction, acceleration,</span> and <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">mass</span>. Write the terms on the board and ask volunteers to come to the board to write a definition or an example or draw a sketch that demonstrates the physics meaning of the word. If students can’t remember the physics meaning of any terms, ask them to give the common meaning of a term. Then guide them to relate that to the physics meaning. </p>
			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span>  During classroom discussions, partner <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced</span> students, if possible. Encourage partners to share their thoughts before they respond or enter a classroom discussion. If grouping is not possible, work with students individually. Allow wait time for students to process their thoughts.</p>

			<p class="Body-A">Explain, act out, and define the academic vocabulary your students will need to master to understand this chapter. Use strategies such as those suggested below for each word. Then have the students complete a vocabulary card for each term. A printable Vocabulary Card template can be found in the Student Activities. </p>
			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Beginning:</span> Pronounce each word and have students repeat after you. Then use realia; simple, accessible language; and/or gestures to help students understand. For example, for the term <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">orbit</span> use total physical response. Have two students come to the front of the room. Ask one student to walk in a circle around the other student. Say, <span class="Body-Handwrite">____ is orbiting around ____. </span></p>

			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Advanced/Advanced High:</span> See <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning/Intermediate.</span> Ask students to describe how objects in space orbit each other. Ask, <span class="Body-Handwrite">What shape does the path of an orbit make? Do you think it is a perfect circle or more of an oval? Why? </span>Record students’ theories on the board and return to them when you disucss <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">orbit</span><span class="Body-Handwrite"> </span>in the chapter.			</p>
			<p class="Head-Sub1"><a id="key"></a>Teach Key Vocabulary</p>
			<!-- <p class="Body-A">(1.A1, 1.A2, 1.B1, 1.C, 1.D, 1.F, 2.C1, 2.C2, 2.C3, 2.C4, 2.D1, 2.D2, 2.E3, 2.I3, 2.I4, 3.B3, 3.D1, 3.D2, 3.E, 3.F2, 3.G2, 3.H3, 4.C2, 4.D, 4.F1, 4.F2, 4.F3, 4.F5, 4.F6, 4.F7, 4.F8, 4.F10, 4.G3)</p> -->
			<p class="Body-A">Make sure to preview key vocabulary that might impair understanding. Use strategies such as the following.</p>
			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Beginning/Intermediate:</span> Discuss the common meaning of the key vocabulary. For example, discuss the expression <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">escape speed</span>. Explain that <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">escape</span> means “to get away.” Share a photo of a speed limit sign and point out and pronounce the word <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">speed</span>. Say, <span class="Body-Handwrite">The number on this sign tells us how fast we can drive, or what the legal speed is.</span> So the common meaning of <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">escape speed</span> is “how fast we must drive to get away.”</p>
			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Beginning/Intermediate/Advanced/Advanced High:</span> Explain that in physics, <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">escape speed</span> is “the speed an object must reach in order to escape the gravitational pull of a planet.” Then ask students to relate the common meaning of the key words to the physics meaning. </p>
			<p class="Body-Indent">Use the 2-Column Notes graphic organizer in the Student Activities and suggest that students record the key vocabulary in the left column and its cognate in the right column. Ask students to keep completed 2-Column Notes in a physics notebook for reference. </p>

			<p class="Body-A">Use strategies that represent different modalities to support second language learners as they interact with the content.</p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Whiteboards</span>  Pair <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced</span> students and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced High</span> students to study the whiteboards that introduce new concepts. Encourage the partners to begin by listening to the oral explanation that accompanies all whiteboards as they first view the new concept, providing visual and auditory support. Then encourage partners to go step-by-step through the whiteboards again with the more advanced student pointing out and reading the explanation text. Encourage the <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> students to question their partners for clarification. Suggest that all students use the T-Chart Notes graphic organizer from the Student Activities for recording formulas and summarizing concepts in their native language or English, depending on their language proficiency. Encourage students to keep their notes in a physics notebook for handy reference.</p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Videos  </span>Pair <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced</span> students and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced High</span> students to view videos that introduce academic vocabulary and key concepts. Encourage discussion between partners and have them use the T-Chart Notes graphic organizer for recording formulas and summarizing concepts in their native language or English, depending on their language proficiency. Encourage students to discuss and review their notes to help them prepare for exams.</p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Vocabulary</span>  Before students complete each section, review any pertinent vocabulary. Write the unknown words on the board and ask volunteers to draw a sketch or write a synonym or definition for each. Although many of the pages have images, students may not know which part of the image refers to the vocabulary, so it is helpful to have them preview the vocabulary. Have students use a copy of the Chapter 8 Vocabulary reproducible in the Student Activities to record cognates, definitions in their native language, or diagrams to help them understand and remember.</p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet-indent-only">&#9;Pertinent Vocabulary: Topic 8.5: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">track, race, yo-yo, string, Newton; </span>Topic 8.6: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">science fiction stories, space station, rotating, astronaut,</span> <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">loop; </span>Topic 8.8: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">satellite, tennis balls, newtons; </span>Topic 8.10: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">sea level, equator, summit, peak, gut, </span><span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">iron ore, pumice; </span>Topic 8.12: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">stone, projectile; </span>Topic 8.15: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">rocket; </span>Topic 8.18: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">pie slice, sweep out, comet</span>. Supply synonyms whenever possible. For example, share with students that <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">rotating</span> is another word for <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">turning</span>; <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">loop</span> is another expression for <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">circle</span>; <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">summit</span> is another word for <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">peak</span>; <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">gut</span> is another word for <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">stomach</span>; and <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">stone</span> is another word for <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">rock</span>. Remind students to file their Chapter 8 Vocabulary sheets in their physics notebooks. </p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Language of Math/Science</span>  Record the following terms on the board: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">circular, horizontal, vertical, two o’clock on a circle, altitude, radius, vice versa, elliptical, body, period, circumference, focus, proportional, y-axis, x-axis, logarithmic</span>. Read through the list slowly as students repeat. Then read each term again, and ask students to give a thumbs-up or thumbs-down based on whether they are familiar with each word. Finally, pair <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced</span> or <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced/High</span> students to group the words by how they relate to each other. For example, <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">horizontal</span> and <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">vertical</span> are antonyms and describe the <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">y-axis</span> and <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">x-axis,</span> so those four words could go in one group. Explain to students that there are many correct groupings for the words, but students will need to be ready to explain their reasoning for the groupings they choose. When pairs complete their groupings, have a class sharing and discussion of the meanings of each term, the groupings, and the reasoning for each.</p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Everyday Applications</span>  Divide students into multilevel groups. Give each group a short science fiction story that makes reference to some of the concepts from this chapter (<span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">gravity, orbits, satellites,</span> etc.). Ask groups to read the stories and identify the physics concepts that they’ve learned in this chapter. Challenge students to determine if the stories are using the physics concepts correctly. Have a class sharing during which each group shares a few examples.</p>
			<p class="Heading-1-A-A"><a id="practice"></a>Practice</p>
			<p class="Body-A">Support second language learners as they practice new concepts by interfacing with Kinetic Books interactive content. </p>

			<p class="Body-Number-Decimal">1.)&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Interactive Activities</span>  Pair second language students with native language speakers for these “hands-on” activities. Ask the native language speakers to read the directions aloud and then model how to perform the activity. Encourage them to use metacognition, or think-alouds, as they play, explaining what they are doing and why as their partners observe. Encourage second language students to request clarification and, when they are ready, to enjoy the interactive activity themselves. Suggest that students complete a Think, Pair, Share template together once they complete the activity. The template can be found in the Student Activities. Then provide time for both partners to share with the group what they have learned from the interactive activity. </p>
			<p class="Body-Number-Decimal">2.)&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Quickchecks</span>  Project Quickchecks on a screen or whiteboard for all ELL students. Read through each problem as ELL students solve them independently by writing their answers on paper. Then have students enter their answers and check, encouraging them to use the Step function for additional help. </p>
			<p class="Body-Number-Decimal">3.) <span class="Body-Bold">Practice Chapter Test </span> Project the practice chapter test on a screen or whiteboard and read the problems as second language students write their answers independently. Then pair <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced</span> students and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced High</span> students to view and check answers and review specific sections. Encourage them to discuss concepts as they review sections. Suggest they refer to their physics notebooks. </p>
