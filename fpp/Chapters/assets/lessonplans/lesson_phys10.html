 <p class="Body-A">Explain, act out, and define the academic vocabulary your students will need to master to understand this chapter. Use strategies such as those suggested below for each word. Then have the students complete a vocabulary card for each term. A printable Vocabulary Card template can be found in the Student Activities. </p>
 <p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Beginning/Intermediate:</span> Pronounce each word and have students repeat after you. Then use realia; simple, accessible language; and/or gestures to help students understand. For example, for the term <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">density</span> use a clear glass or plastic glass or container filled with water, some oil, and a small stone. Pour some oil into the water in the container. Ask, <span class="Body-Handwrite">Which has more density, the oil or the water?</span> Ask students to explain their answer. Then drop the stone into the container and ask, <span class="Body-Handwrite">Which has more density, the stone or the water? Which has the most density? </span></p>
 <p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Advanced/Advanced High: </span>See<span class="Body-Bold"> Beginning/Intermediate. </span> Then ask students to define <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">density</span> in their own words, using what they know about weight, mass, and matter from previous chapters<span class="Body-Handwrite">. </span>Record students’ definitions on the board, correcting and explaining them as necessary. </p>

 <p class="Body-A">Make sure to preview key vocabulary that might impair understanding. Use strategies such as the following:</p>
 <p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Beginning/Intermediate:</span> Discuss the common meaning of the key vocabulary. For example, discuss the common meaning of the word <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">atmosphere</span> by writing the following sentence on the board: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">The atmosphere in the room changed when the teacher walked in.</span> Read the sentence aloud, pointing to each word as you read. Establish that <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">atmosphere</span> means “the general feeling in a room or area.” Discuss how the atmosphere in the room might change when the teacher walks in. <span class="Body-Handwrite">What else might cause the atmosphere in the classroom to change? </span>(a fire drill, a misbehaving student, the principal)</span></p>
 <p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Beginning/Intermediate/Advanced/Advanced High</span>: Share a photo of the Earth. Point out the atmosphere. Explain that the <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">atmosphere</span> is the layer of gas surrounding the Earth. Then ask students to relate the common meaning of the key word to the physics meaning.</p>
 <p class="Body-Indent">Use the 2-Column Notes graphic organizer in the Student Activities and suggest that students record the key vocabulary in the left column and its cognate in the right column. Ask students to keep completed 2-Column Notes in a physics notebook for reference. </p>

 <p class="Body-A">Use strategies that represent different modalities to support second language learners as they interact with the content.</p>
 <p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Whiteboards</span> Pair <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced</span> students and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced High</span> students to study the whiteboards that introduce new concepts. Encourage the partners to begin by listening to the oral explanation that accompanies all whiteboards as they first view the new concept, providing visual and auditory support. Then encourage partners to go step-by-step through the whiteboards again with the more advanced student pointing out and reading the explanation text. Encourage the <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> students to question their partners for clarification. Suggest that all students use the T-Chart Notes graphic organizer from the Student Activities for recording formulas and summarizing concepts in their native language or English, depending on their language proficiency. Encourage students to keep their notes in a physics notebook for handy reference.</p>
 <p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Videos </span>Pair <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced</span> students and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced High</span> students to view videos that introduce academic vocabulary and key concepts. Encourage discussion between partners and have them use the T-Chart Notes graphic organizer for recording formulas and summarizing concepts in their native language or English, depending on their language proficiency. Encourage students to discuss and review their notes to help them prepare for exams.</p>
 <p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Vocabulary</span> Before students complete each section, review any pertinent vocabulary. Although many of the pages have images, students may not know which part of the image refers to the vocabulary, so it is helpful to have them preview the vocabulary. Write the unknown words on the board and ask volunteers to draw a sketch or write a synonym or definition for each. Have students use a copy of the Chapter 10 Vocabulary reproducible in the Student Activities to record cognates, definitions in their native language, or diagrams to help them understand and remember.</p>
 <p class="Body-Bullet-indent-only">&#9;Pertinent Vocabulary: Topic 10.1: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">glacier, ice, fishbowl; </span>Topic 10.2: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">aquarium; </span>Topic 10.3: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">lead,</span> <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">gold brick; </span>Topic 10.5: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">scuba diving, Jupiter, swimming pool, tank; </span>Topic 10.7: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">altitude, jetliner, pressurized cabin, sea level, mountain summit, peak, Himalayas, Everest, sphere, hemisphere, horses,</span> <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">mercury, column, surface, reservoir; </span>Topic 10.8: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">gauge, bicycle pump; </span>Topic 10.9: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">paintbrush, bristles, pond, water strider; </span>Topic 10.11: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">wetsuit, weight belt, metal, sink, inflatable vest, ship, steel, Titanic; </span>Topic 10.13: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">block, massive, piston, garage; </span>Topic 10.14: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">motor oil, river, channel, rapids, pipe</span>. Remind students to file their Chapter 10 Vocabulary sheets in their physics notebooks. </p>
 <p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Language of Math/Science</span> Record the following terms on the board: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">weight, height, ratio, depth, cubic meter, calculate, consider other factors, </span>and <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">properties</span>. Read through the list slowly as students repeat. Then read each term again and ask students to give a thumbs-up or thumbs-down based on whether they are familiar with each word. Finally, pair <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced</span> or <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced/High</span> students to group the words by how they relate to each other. For example, <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">weight</span> and <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">height</span> are both <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">properties </span>of an object, so these three words could be grouped. Explain to students that there are many correct groupings for the words, but students will need to be ready to explain their reasoning for the groupings they choose. When pairs complete their groupings, have a class sharing and discussion of the meanings of each term, the groupings, and the reasoning for each.</p>
 <p class="Heading-1-A-A"><a id="practice"></a>Practice</p>
 <p class="Body-A">Support second language learners as they practice new concepts by interfacing with Kinetic Books interactive content. </p>

 <p class="Body-Number-Decimal">1.)&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Interactive Activities</span> Pair second language students with native language speakers for these “hands-on” activities. Ask the native language speakers to read the directions aloud and then model how to perform the activity. Encourage them to use metacognition, or think-alouds, as they play, explaining what they are doing and why as their partners observe. Encourage second language students to request clarification and, when they are ready, to enjoy the interactive activity themselves. Suggest that students complete a Think, Pair, Share template together once they complete the activity. The template can be found in the Student Activities. Then provide time for both partners to share with the group what they have learned from the interactive activity. </p>
 <p class="Body-Number-Decimal">2.)&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Quickchecks</span> Project Quickchecks on a screen or whiteboard for all ELL students.
