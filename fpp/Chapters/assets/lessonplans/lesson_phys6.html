			<p class="Body-A">Before introducing physics terms presented in this chapter, review the following physics concepts from previous chapters: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">displacement, direction, force, mass, parallel, speed,</span> and <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">scalar</span>. Write the terms on the board and ask volunteers to come to the board to write a definition or an example or draw a sketch that demonstrates the physics meaning of the word. If students can’t remember the physics meaning of any terms, begin with the common meaning of a term. Then guide students to relate the common meaning to the physics meaning. </p>
			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span>  During classroom discussions, partner <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced</span> students, if possible. Encourage partners to share their thoughts before they respond or enter a classroom discussion. If grouping is not possible, work with students individually. Allow wait time for students to process their thoughts.</p>
			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span>  Group <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced High</span> students.

			<p class="Body-A">Explain, act out, and define the academic vocabulary your students will need to master to understand this chapter. Use strategies such as those suggested below for each word. Then have the students complete a vocabulary card for each term. A printable Vocabulary Card template can be found in the Student Activities. </p>
			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Beginning:</span> Pronounce each word and have students repeat after you. Then use realia; simple, accessible language; and/or gestures to help students understand. For example, for the terms <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">elastic potential energy</span> and <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">gravitational potential energy,</span> use an elastic band. Write the terms on the board for students to refer to during the discussion. Show the elastic band to the students and then set it on a desk at the front of the room. Ask the class to consider if the elastic has any energy or if any force is acting on the elastic band. (Students should identify that gravity is acting on the elastic band and keeping it on the desk.) </p>
			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate: </span>See<span class="Body-Bold"> Beginning. </span>Then pick up the elastic band and begin to stretch it. <span class="Body-Handwrite">What kind of energy does the elastic band have now? Does it still have gravitational potential energy? </span>Stretch the elastic band even more. <span class="Body-Handwrite">Did the elastic potential energy change? Did the gravitational potential energy change? </span></p>
	  <p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Beginning/Intermediate/Advanced/Advanced High:</span> Then let the elastic band go, so that it flies through the air (away from students). Ask students to consider what happened to the energy. <span class="Body-Handwrite">What happened to the elastic potential energy? What happened to the gravitational potential energy? </span>Record students’ theories on the board and return to them when you discuss kinetic energy and energy transfer. </p>

			<p class="Body-A">Make sure to preview key vocabulary that might impair understanding. Use strategies such as the following.</p>
			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Beginning/Intermediate:</span> Discuss the common meaning of the key vocabulary. For example, ask students what the expression <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">conservation of energy</span> commonly means (not working too hard; act of resting).</p>
			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Beginning/Intermediate/Advanced/Advanced High</span>: Give students the physics meaning of the key vocabulary. For example, <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">conservation of energy</span> means that energy is never lost, only changed. Then ask students to relate the common meanings of key words to the physics meanings.</p>
	  <p class="Body-Indent">Use the 2-Column Notes graphic organizer in the Student Activities and suggest that students record the key vocabulary in the left column and its cognate and meaning in the right column. Ask students to keep completed 2-Column Notes in a physics notebook for reference. </p>

			<p class="Body-A">Use strategies that represent different modalities to support second language learners as they interact with the content.</p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Whiteboards</span>  Pair <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced</span> students and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced High</span> students to study the whiteboards that introduce new concepts. Encourage the partners to begin by listening to the oral explanation that accompanies all whiteboards as they first view the new concept, providing visual and auditory support. Then encourage partners to go step-by-step through the whiteboards again with the more advanced student pointing out and reading the explanation text. Encourage the <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> students to question their partners for clarification. Suggest that all students use the T-Chart Notes graphic organizer for recording formulas and summarizing concepts in their native language or English, depending on their language proficiency. Encourage students to keep their notes in a physics notebook for handy reference.</p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Videos  </span>Pair <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced</span> students and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced High</span> students to view videos that introduce academic vocabulary and key concepts. Encourage discussion between partners and have them use the T-Chart Notes graphic organizer from the Student Activities for recording formulas and summarizing concepts in their native language or English, depending on their language proficiency. Encourage students to discuss and review their notes to help them prepare for exams.</p>
	  <p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Vocabulary</span>  Before students complete each section, review any pertinent vocabulary. Write the unknown words on the board and ask volunteers to draw a sketch or write a synonym or definition for each. Although many of the sections have images, students may not know which part of the image refers to the vocabulary, so it is helpful to have them preview the vocabulary. Have students use a copy of the Chapter 6 Vocabulary reproducible in the Student Activities to record cognates, definitions in their native language, or diagrams to help them understand and remember.</p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet-indent-only">&#9;Pertinent Vocabulary: Topic 6.1: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">spring; </span>Topic 6.4: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">curve; </span>Topic 6.7: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">locomotive, ping-pong ball; </span>6.10: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">barbell, string; </span>Topic 6.12: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">bow, arrow; </span>Topic Topic 6.19: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">cable, engine; </span>Topic 6.20: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">dam, blades; </span>Topic 6.21: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">revolution, track, hill</span>. Wherever applicable, supply synonyms (for example, you can remind students that <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">spring</span> is another word for <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">coil</span>, <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">ping-pong ball</span> is another expression for <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">table tennis ball</span>, <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">barbell</span> is another word for <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">weight</span>, and <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">revolution</span> is another word for <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">turn</span>.)<span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US"> </span>Remind students to file their Chapter 6 Vocabulary sheets in their physics notebooks. </p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Language of Math/Science</span>  Record the following terms on the board: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">precise, accurate, approximation, calculate, substitute, solve for, simplify, constant, system</span>. Read through the list slowly as students repeat. Then read each term again and ask students to give a thumbs-up or thumbs-down based on whether they are familiar with each word. Finally, pair <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced</span> or <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced/High</span> students to group the words by how they relate to each other. For example, <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">calculate</span> and <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">solve for</span> are synonyms and so they could go together. Explain to students that there are many correct groupings for the words, but students will need to be ready to explain their reasoning for the groupings they choose. When pairs complete their groupings, have a class sharing and discussion of the meanings of each term, the groupings, and the reasoning for each.</p>

			<p class="Body-Number-Decimal">1.)&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Interactive Activities</span>  Pair second language students with native language speakers for these “hands-on” activities. Ask the native language speakers to read the directions aloud and then model how to perform the activity. Encourage them to use metacognition, or think-alouds, as they play, explaining what they are doing and why as their partners observe. Encourage second language students to request clarification and, when they are ready, to enjoy the interactive activity themselves. Suggest that students complete a Think, Pair, Share template together once they complete the activity. The template can be found in the Student Activities. Then provide time for both partners to share with the group what they have learned from the interactive activity. </p>
			<p class="Body-Number-Decimal">2.)&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Quickchecks</span>  Project Quickchecks on a screen or whiteboard for all ELL students.
