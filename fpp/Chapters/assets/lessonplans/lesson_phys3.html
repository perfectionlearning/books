<p class="Body-A">Before introducing physics terms presented in this chapter, review the necessary mathematical concepts. Write the following vocabulary on the board: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">equation, denominator, </span>and<span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US"> square root.</span> Ask volunteers to come to the board and write an example of each one. Then to reinforce the vocabulary for the whole group, ask each student to write an equation on an index card or a sheet of scrap paper. Have some students share theirs with the group. Next ask students to write an equation that includes a denominator (a fraction). Have volunteers read aloud these equations. Finally, ask students to write an equation that involves a square root. Have volunteers share these on the board and discuss how to solve them. </p>
<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> During classroom discussions, partner <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced</span> students, if possible. Encourage partners to share their thoughts before they respond or enter a classroom discussion. If grouping is not possible, work with students individually. Allow wait time for students to process their thoughts.</p>

			<p class="Body-A"><img src="assets/lessonplans/images/chart_ch3.gif" width="460" height="109" alt="variable"></p>
			<p class="Body-A">Explain, act out, and define the academic vocabulary your students will need to master to understand this chapter. Use strategies such as those suggested below for each word. Then have the students complete a vocabulary card for each term. A printable Vocabulary Card template can be found in the Student Activities. </p>
			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Beginning:</span>  Pronounce each word and have students repeat after you. Then use realia; simple, accessible language; and/or gestures to help students understand. For example, for the word <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">variable</span>, write a simple algebraic expression such as <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">x + 1 = 3</span>. Point to the <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">x</span> and explain that the letter <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">x</span> is known as the <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">variable</span>. Use cognates to help Spanish speakers whenever possible. </p>
			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate: </span> See <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span>. Add a second simple equation such as <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">x + 1 = 4. </span>Explain that the <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">variable x</span> stands for a number. “Read” the first equation as you point to the variable, constant, and answer. Ask students to “read” it after you. Then ask, <span class="Body-Handwrite">What number plus 1 equals 3? </span>Establish that the number is <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">2</span>. <span class="Body-Handwrite">So in that equation, x, the variable, stands for 2.</span> Write a <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">2</span> above the variable and read and point, <span class="Body-Handwrite">2 plus 1 equals 3.</span> Continue in the same manner for the second sentence, establishing that in that equation <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">x</span> stands for a different number, or <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">3</span>. <span class="Body-Handwrite">So the variable x has different values, or changes, depending on the other numbers in the equation.</span> Always refer to cognates whenever possible.</p>
			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Advanced/Advanced High:</span>  Write the word <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">variable</span>. Explain that the base word of <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">variable</span> is <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">vary</span>. Remind students that the word <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">vary</span> means “to change.” Ask students to suggest things that vary. Examples might include the weather, the price of gas, the price of cell phones, the time the sun sets or rises, how much homework they have, their class schedule from day to day, and so on. Write two simple algebraic equations such as <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">x + 1 = 3</span> and <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">x + 1 = 4.</span> Solve for <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">x</span> in both equations. Point out and explain that in both equations, the letter <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">x</span> is the variable, but the value of <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">x</span> changes, or varies, based on the other numbers.</p>

			<!-- <p class="Body-A">(1.A2, 1.C, 2.C1, 2.C2, 2.I3, 3.B2, 3.G2, 4.D, 4.F1, 4.F2, 4.F3, 4.F5, 4.F6, 4.F7, 4.F8, 4.F9, 4.F10, 4.G3)</p> -->
			<p class="Body-A">Make sure to preview key vocabulary that might impair understanding. Use strategies such as the following.</p>
			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Beginning/Intermediate:</span> Discuss the more literal meaning of the term <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">bull’s-eye</span> with realia by displaying a photo of a bull and pointing out the eye. Contrast that with a photo of a target and point out the bull’s-eye in the center. Ask students to suggest situations where targets would be used. Explain that targets measure accuracy with the bull’s-eye indicating an accurate shot.</p>
			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Beginning/Intermediate/Advanced/Advanced High:</span> Discuss the word <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">bull’s-eye</span> in the context in which it is used. Explain that in this context, <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">bull’s-eye</span> relates to a target and is used to explain the terms <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">precision</span> and <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">accuracy</span>.</p>
			<p class="Body-Indent">Use the 2-Column Notes graphic organizer in the Student Activities and suggest that students record the key vocabulary in the left column and its cognate or meaning in the right column. Ask students to keep completed 2-Column Notes in a physics notebook for reference. </p>

			<p class="Body-A">Use strategies that represent different modalities to support second language learners as they interact with the content.</p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Whiteboards</span>  Pair <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced</span> students and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced High</span> students to study the whiteboards that introduce new concepts. Encourage the partners to begin by listening to the oral explanation that accompanies all whiteboards as they first view the new concept, providing visual and auditory support. Then encourage partners to go step-by-step through the whiteboards again with the more advanced student pointing out and reading the explanation text. Encourage the <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> students to question their partners for clarification. Suggest that all students use the T-Chart Notes graphic organizer from the Student Activities for recording formulas and summarizing concepts in their native language or English, depending on their language proficiency. Encourage students to keep their notes in a physics notebook for handy reference.</p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Videos  </span>Pair <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced</span> students and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced High</span> students to view videos that introduce academic vocabulary and key concepts. Encourage discussion between partners and have them use the T-Chart Notes graphic organizer for recording formulas and summarizing concepts in their native language or English, depending on their language proficiency. Encourage students to discuss and review their notes to help them prepare for exams.</p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">The Language of Math</span>  Display a list of simple algebraic expressions and equations. Read through the list slowly as students follow along. Then read each again, and ask individual students to give a thumbs-up or thumbs-down as to whether you read each correctly. Finally, pair <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced</span> or <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced High</span> students to practice “reading” the expressions and equations. </p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">PEMDAS</span>  Support second language students and provide them more context so that they can make use of this handy acronym for the order of operations. Suggest that students use the PEMDAS template from the Student Activities to define the acronynm and create a handy reference. Have them define each letter of the acronym with the English word and Spanish cognate or visual symbol, such as an <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">addition</span> problem or plus sign for addition, which doesn’t have a cognate. </p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Using a Calculator with Scientific Notation</span>  Partner second language students with native English speakers. Ask the English-speaking student to read and demonstrate step-by-step how to perform the different operations as explained in the lesson. Then have the English-speaking student guide his/her partner step-by-step in performing each operation. Finally, encourage the second language student to practice and perform operations as prompted by his/her partner. This cooperative approach will be of benefit to both students.</p>
			<p class="Heading-1-A-A"><a id="practice"></a>Practice</p>
			<p class="Body-A">Support second language learners as they practice new concepts by interfacing with Kinetic Books interactive content. </p>

			<p class="Body-Number-Decimal">1.)&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Interactive Activities</span>  Pair second language students with native language speakers for these “hands-on” activities. Ask the native language speakers to read the directions aloud and then model how to perform the activity. Encourage them to use metacognition, or think-alouds, as they play, explaining what they are doing and why as their partners observe. Encourage second language students to request clarification and, when they are ready, to enjoy the interactive activity themselves. Suggest that students complete a Think, Pair, Share template together once they complete the activity. The template can be found in the Student Activities. Then provide time for both partners to share with the group what they have learned from the interactive activity. </p>
			<p class="Body-Number-Decimal">2.)&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Quickchecks</span>  Project Quickchecks on a screen or whiteboard for all ELL students. Read through each problem as ELL students solve them independently by writing their answers on paper. Then have students enter their answers and check, encouraging them to use the Step function for additional help. </p>
			<p class="Body-Number-Decimal">3.)&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Practice Chapter Test </span> Project the practice chapter test on a screen or whiteboard and read the problems as second language students write their answers independently. Then pair <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced</span> students and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced High</span> students to view and check answers and review specific sections. Encourage them to discuss concepts as they review sections. Suggest they refer to their physics notebooks. </p>
			<p class="Body-Number-Decimal">4.)&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Summary Videos</span>  Pair <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced</span> students and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced High</span> students to view videos that summarize key concepts. Encourage discussion between partners. Have them refer to their physics notebooks as they view the videos and review and discuss the concepts. </p></div>
