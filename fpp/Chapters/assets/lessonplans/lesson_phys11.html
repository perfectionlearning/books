			<p class="Body-A para-style-override-1">Explain, act out, and define the academic vocabulary your students will need to master to understand this chapter. Use strategies such as those suggested below for each word. Then have the students complete a vocabulary card for each term. A printable Vocabulary Card template can be found in the Student Activities. </p>
			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Beginning/Intermediate:</span> Pronounce each word and have students repeat after you. Then use realia; simple, accessible language; and/or gestures to help students understand. For example, for the terms <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">calorimeter/calorimetry,</span> create a model of a calorimeter with a clear container of water, an object, and a thermometer. Say, <span class="Body-Handwrite">This is a calorimeter. What are the parts of a calorimeter?</span> Have students name the parts. Help them as necessary.</p>
			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Advanced/Advanced High: </span>See<span class="Body-Bold"> Beginning/Intermediate. </span>Then ask students to guess how a calorimeter works and what its purpose is.

			<p class="Body-A">Make sure to preview key vocabulary that might impair understanding. Use strategies such as the following.</p>
			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Beginning/Intermediate:</span> Discuss the common meaning of the key vocabulary. For example, ask students what the word <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">gas</span> commonly means (fuel for a car). </p>
			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Beginning/Intermediate/Advanced/Advanced High</span>: Give students the physics meaning of the key vocabulary. For example, <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">gas</span> is a state of matter known as a fluid where the molecules have no fixed relationship. Then ask students to relate the common meanings of key words to the physics meanings.</p>
			<p class="Body-Indent">Use the 2-Column Notes graphic organizer in the Student Activities and suggest that students record the key vocabulary in the left column and its cognate and meaning in the right column.

			<p class="Body-A">Use strategies that represent different modalities to support second language learners as they interact with the content.</p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Whiteboards</span>  Pair <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced</span> students and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced High</span> students to study the whiteboards that introduce new concepts. Encourage the partners to begin by listening to the oral explanation that accompanies all whiteboards as they first view the new concept, providing visual and auditory support. Then encourage partners to go step-by-step through the whiteboards again with the more advanced student pointing out and reading the explanation text. Encourage the <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> students to question their partners for clarification. Suggest that all students use the T-Chart Notes graphic organizer for recording formulas and summarizing concepts in their native language or English, depending on their language proficiency. Encourage students to keep their notes in a physics notebook for handy reference.</p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Videos  </span>Pair <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced</span> students and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced High</span> students to view videos that introduce academic vocabulary and key concepts. Encourage discussion between partners and have them use the T-Chart Notes graphic organizer from the Student Activities for recording formulas and summarizing concepts in their native language or English, depending on their language proficiency. Encourage students to discuss and review their notes to help them prepare for exams.</p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Vocabulary</span>  Before students complete each section, review any pertinent vocabulary. Write the unknown words on the board and ask volunteers to draw a sketch or write a synonym or definition for each. Although many of the sections have images, students may not know which part of the image refers to the vocabulary, so it is helpful to have them preview the vocabulary. Have students use a copy of the Chapter 11 Vocabulary reproducible in the Student Activities to record cognates, definitions in their native language, or diagrams to help them understand and remember.</p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet-indent-only">&#9;Pertinent Vocabulary: Topic 11.1: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">neon, hydrogen, oxygen; </span>Topic 11.2: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">paper clip, iron, metals, melt, weak, compress, walls, container, balance; </span>Topic 11.4: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">pot of water, engine, car; </span>Topic 11.5: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">rotate, brick, building, spring; </span>Topic 11.6: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">blocks, thermostat, furnace, air conditioner; </span>Topic 11.7: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">burner, dance, song, chill out, heat up; </span>Topic 11.9: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">physicists, frequencies, musical scale, freezing, boiling; </span>Topic 11.13: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">cooler, warmer, ice cream, apple, tree, hot, refrigerator, kitchen; </span>Topic 11.14: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">lead; </span>Topic 11.15: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">insulation, external environment, surrounding; </span>Topic 11.17: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">ice cubes, steam, condenses; </span>Topic 11.18: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">vertical, horizontal; </span>Topic 11.20: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">cast iron pan, stove, window, thickness; </span>Topic 11.21: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">oven, fans, rise, oil, vinegar, salad dressing, pump, heating system; </span>Topic 11.22: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">sunlight, microwave ovens, medical, invisible, roof, home, solar collector, coal, petroleum, carbon dioxide; </span>Topic 11.24: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">jar, lid; </span>Topic 11.24: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">radiator, coolant, lake, sink, aquatic life, crucial</span>.<span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US"> </span>Remind students to file their Chapter 11 Vocabulary sheets in their physics notebooks. </p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Language of Math/Science</span>  Record the following terms on the board: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">matter, molecules, atoms, bonds, relationships, crystal, force of attraction, elastically, ideal, ions, electrically neutral, convert, properties, quotient, reciprocal, area, dense, </span>and <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">ratio</span>. Read through the list slowly as students repeat. Then read each term again and ask students to give a thumbs-up or thumbs-down based on whether they are familiar with each word. Finally, pair <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced</span> or <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced/High</span> students to group the words by how they relate to each other. For example, <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">matter</span> is made up of <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">molecules</span> and <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">atoms</span> that are <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">bonded</span> together, so these four words could go together in one group. Explain to students that there are many correct groupings for the words, but students will need to be ready to explain their reasoning for the groupings they choose. When pairs complete their groupings, have a class sharing and discussion of the meanings of each term, the groupings, and the reasoning for each.</p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Everyday Applications</span>  Divide students into multilevel groups. Give each group a thermometer or thermostat manual (you may be able to find these online). Ask groups to skim the manual, looking for terms discussed in this chapter. Then ask them to determine if the terms are used in the same way they are in this chapter. Have a class sharing in which each group presents some of the terms they found.</p>

			<p class="Body-Number-Decimal">1.)&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Interactive Activities</span>  Pair second language students with native language speakers for these “hands-on” activities. Ask the native language speakers to read the directions aloud and then model how to perform the activity. Encourage them to use metacognition, or think-alouds, as they play, explaining what they are doing and why as their partners observe. Encourage second language students to request clarification and, when they are ready, to enjoy the interactive activity themselves. Suggest that students complete a Think, Pair, Share template together once they complete the activity. The template can be found in the Student Activities. Then provide time for both partners to share with the group what they have learned from the interactive activity. </p>
