			<p class="Body-A">Before introducing physics terms presented in this chapter, review the following physics concepts from previous chapters: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">acceleration, speed, displacement, velocity, vector, variable, slope, rise,</span> and <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">run</span>. Write the terms on the board and ask volunteers to come to the board to write a definition or an example or draw a sketch that demonstrates the physics meaning of the word. If students can’t remember the physics meaning of any terms, begin with the common meaning of a term. Then guide students to relate the common meaning to the physics meaning. </p>
			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span>  During classroom discussions, partner <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced</span> students, if possible. Encourage partners to share their thoughts before they respond or enter a classroom discussion. If grouping is not possible, work with students individually. Allow wait time for students to process their thoughts.</p>
			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span>  Group <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced High</span> students.

			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Advanced</span>  Allow wait time for students to gather their thoughts. Encourage partner discussion. As these students help their <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span>-level partners, they will be improving their own language skills at the same time they lend language support to their partners.</p>

			<p class="Body-A"><img src="assets/lessonplans/images/chart_ch2.gif" alt="freefall acceleration" width="460" height="109"></p>
			<p class="Body-A">Explain, act out, and define the academic vocabulary your students will need to master to understand this chapter. Use strategies such as those suggested below for each word. Then have the students complete a vocabulary card for each term. A printable Vocabulary Card template can be found in the Student Activities. </p>
			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Beginning/Intermediate:</span> Pronounce each word and have students repeat after you. Then use realia; simple, accessible language; and/or gestures to help students understand. For example, for the term <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">freefall acceleration,</span> use a light object and a heavy object. Stand on a chair and drop the objects at the same time. Ask students, <span class="Body-Handwrite">Did the objects fall at the same acceleration or different accelerations?</span> Drop the objects again and ask students to observe and guess at their accelerations. Then ask, <span class="Body-Handwrite">Did the objects reach the ground at the same time?</span> If necessary, repeat the experiment again. Discuss why the objects might fall at the same acceleration. <span class="Body-Handwrite">What do you think freefall acceleration means?</span> Record correct definitions on the board, inserting changes as necessary. </p>
			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Beginning/Intermediate/Advanced/Advanced High:</span> Ask students to think about why freefall acceleration is the same for all objects. <span class="Body-Handwrite">Why would different objects of different weights and masses fall at the same time?</span> Record theories on the board. You may want to introduce the terms <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">gravity</span> and <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">vacuum</span> at this point.</p>
			<p class="Head-Sub1"><a id="key"></a>Teach Key Vocabulary</p>
			<!-- <p class="Body-A">(1.A1, 1.A2, 1.B1, 1.C, 1.D, 1.F, 2.C1, 2.C2, 2.C3, 2.C4, 2.D1, 2.D2, 2.E3, 2.I3, 2.I4, 3.B3, 3.D1, 3.D2, 3.E, 3.F2, 3.G2, 3.H3, 4.D, 4.F1, 4.F2, 4.F3, 4.F5, 4.F6, 4.F7, 4.F8, 4.F10, 4.G3)</p> -->
			<p class="Body-A">Make sure to preview key vocabulary that might impair understanding. Use strategies such as the following.</p>
			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Beginning/Intermediate:</span> Discuss the common meaning of the key vocabulary. For example, ask students what the word <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">cluster</span> commonly means (a group of objects close together). Ask students to consider when they have heard the word <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">cluster</span> before (a cluster of grapes, a cluster of stars). Ask a volunteer to draw a cluster of grapes on the board, or show a photo.</p>
			<p class="Body-Indent"><span class="Body-Bold">Beginning/Intermediate/Advanced/Advanced High</span>: Discuss the more specific physics meaning of the key vocabulary. For example, <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">cluster</span> is a group of points near each other on a graph. Draw a cluster of points on a graph. Ask students to relate the physics meaning of the word to the common meaning.</p>
			<p class="Body-Indent">Use the 2-Column Notes graphic organizer in the Student Activities and suggest that students record the key vocabulary in the left column and its cognate or meaning in the right column. Ask students to keep completed 2-Column Notes in a physics notebook for reference. </p>

			<p class="Body-A">Use strategies that represent different modalities to support second language learners as they interact with the content.</p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Whiteboards</span>  Pair <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced</span> students and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced High</span> students to study the whiteboards that introduce new concepts. Encourage the partners to begin by listening to the oral explanation that accompanies all whiteboards as they first view the new concept, providing visual and auditory support. Then encourage partners to go step-by-step through the whiteboards again with the more advanced student pointing out and reading the explanation text. Encourage the <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> students to question their partners for clarification. Suggest that all students use the T-Chart Notes graphic organizer from the Student Activities for recording formulas and summarizing concepts in their native language or English, depending on their language proficiency. Encourage students to keep their notes in a physics notebook for handy reference.</p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Videos  </span>Pair <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced</span> students and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced High</span> students to view videos that introduce academic vocabulary and key concepts. Encourage discussion between partners and have them use the T-Chart Notes graphic organizer for recording formulas and summarizing concepts in their native language or English, depending on their language proficiency. Encourage students to discuss and review their notes to help them prepare for exams.</p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Vocabulary</span>  Before students complete each section, review any pertinent vocabulary. Write the unknown words on the board and ask volunteers to draw a sketch or write a synonym or definition for each. Have students use a copy of the Chapter 2 Vocabulary reproducible in the Student Activities to record cognates, definitions in their native language, or diagrams to help them understand and remember.</p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet-indent-only">&#9;Pertinent Vocabulary: Topic 2.2: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">tank, aquarium,</span> <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">steep, springs a leak</span>; Topic 2.5: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">theme park ride, suspense, plummet</span>; Topic 2.11: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">spreadsheet, calculator, Dow Jones average, stock prices</span>; Topic 2.13: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">Galileo Galilei, Leaning Tower of Pisa</span>, <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">vacuum</span>; Topic 2.15: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">train platform, NASA.</span> Remind students to file their Chapter 2 Vocabulary sheets in their physics notebooks. </p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Cultural Differences</span>  Before you complete Section 2.3, you may want to discuss gallons versus liters. Remember, most of your students come from countries that measure liquids in liters, not gallons. Consider solving the equations in this section using liters instead of gallons. </p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Language of Math/Science</span>  Record the following terms on the board: <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">graph, line, origin, ordered pair, elapsed time, calculate, square root, cause and effect, instrument, experiment, emphasize, data, air resistance, substitute, system, positive, force, mass, horizontal, vertical.</span> Read through the list slowly, pointing out each word, and have students repeat. Then read each term again, and ask students to give a thumbs-up or thumbs-down based on whether they are familiar with each word. Finally, pair <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced</span> or <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced/High</span> students to group the words by how they relate to each other. For example, <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">graph, line, origin,</span> and <span class="Body-italic" xml:lang="en-US">ordered pair</span> are all words having to do with graphing, so these four words could go in one group. Explain to students that there are many correct groupings for the words, but students will need to be ready to explain their reasoning for the groupings they choose. When pairs complete their groupings, have a class sharing and discussion of the meanings of each term, the groupings, and the reasoning for each.</p>
			<p class="Body-Bullet">•&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Using a Spreadsheet to Draw a Scatter Plot and Entering Data in a Graphing Calculator</span>  For Sections 2:16 and 2:17, partner second language students with native English speakers. Ask the English-speaking student to read and demonstrate step-by-step how to perform the different operations as explained in the lesson. Then have the English-speaking student guide his/her partner step-by-step in performing each operation. Finally, encourage the second language student to practice and perform operations as prompted by his/her partner. This cooperative approach will be of benefit to both students.</p>
			<p class="Heading-1-A-A"><a id="practice"></a>Practice</p>
			<p class="Body-A">Support second language learners as they practice new concepts by interfacing with Kinetic Books interactive content. </p>

			<p class="Body-Number-Decimal">1.)&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Interactive Activities</span>  Pair second language students with native language speakers for these “hands-on” activities. Ask the native language speakers to read the directions aloud and then model how to perform the activity. Encourage them to use metacognition, or think-alouds, as they play, explaining what they are doing and why as their partners observe. Encourage second language students to request clarification and, when they are ready, to enjoy the interactive activity themselves. Suggest that students complete a Think, Pair, Share template together once they complete the activity. The template can be found in the Student Activities. Then provide time for both partners to share with the group what they have learned from the interactive activity. </p>
			<p class="Body-Number-Decimal">2.)&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Quickchecks</span>  Project Quickchecks on a screen or whiteboard for all ELL students. Read through each problem as ELL students solve them independently by writing their answers on paper. Then have students enter their answers and check, encouraging them to use the Step function for additional help. </p>
			<p class="Body-Number-Decimal">3.) <span class="Body-Bold">Practice Chapter Test </span> Project the practice chapter test on a screen or whiteboard and read the problems as second language students write their answers independently. Then pair <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced</span> students and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced High</span> students to view and check answers and review specific sections. Encourage them to discuss concepts as they review sections. Suggest they refer to their physics notebooks. </p>
			<p class="Body-Number-Decimal">4.)&#9;<span class="Body-Bold">Summary Videos</span>  Pair <span class="Body-Bold">Beginning</span> students with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced</span> students and <span class="Body-Bold">Intermediate</span> with <span class="Body-Bold">Advanced High</span> students to view videos that summarize key concepts. Encourage discussion between partners. Have them refer to their physics notebooks as they view the videos and review and discuss the concepts. </p></div>
